<h3>Introduction</h3>Associativity is a property of a function which has an output equivalent&nbsp;no matter what order the function is applied. Addition and product are examples of mathematical functions that are associative as opposed to subtraction and division which are not.<br /><br />Today's post will focus on associative functions and their definitions through Monoids in Haskell.<br /><br /><h3>Associative functions</h3>In the introduction to this post, I spoke about associative functions and gave a few examples. Here are those examples again, but demonstrated mathematically.<br /><br /><pre>(5 * 7) * 9 == 5 * (7 * 9)<br />(5 + 7) + 9 == 5 + (7 + 9)<br />(5 - 7) - 9 != 5 - (7 - 9)<br />(5 / 7) / 9 != 5 / (7 / 9)<br /></pre><br />These examples are pretty straight forward in their reading. You can see clearly that the product and addition operators are associative, subtraction and division not.<br /><br />String concatenation (or array concatenation) is also associative such that:<br /><br /><pre>"Hello " ++ ("World" ++ "!") == ("Hello " ++ "World") ++ "!"</pre><br />These proofs are pretty straight forward. I think that you should have the idea of what associative functions are by now.<br /><br /><h3>Monoids</h3><div>Monoids are Haskell's way of decorating a type that is functionally associative. The definition of a Monoid is as follows.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4627949.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>You can find more information specifically about the type up on the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Monoid.html">Haskell Wiki</a>. From the definition above, we can see that there are 3 functions to be defined.<br /><br /><h3>mempty</h3></div><div>mempty is the identity value for the monoid. It acts more like a constant rather than a function.</div><div><br /></div><h3>mappend</h3><div>mappend is the binary function that can be used between two of these typed Monoids.</div><div><br /></div><h3>mconcat</h3><div>mconcat folds the mappend function between the elements of an array of Monoids.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Monoid Laws</h3><div>Above, I have gone through the basic principals of associative functions which by-and-large cover off on the laws that a Monoid must abide by. There are some explicit ways of writing this concept, there are as follows.</div><div><ul><li><pre>mempty `mappend` x = x</pre></li><li><pre>x `mappend` mempty = x</pre></li><li><pre>(x `mappend` y) `mappend` z = x `mappend` (y `mappend` z)</pre></li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>That's Monoids for you. Take a look as some example implementations on the Wiki and around the web.</div></div>
