    <h1>Applicative Functors in Haskell</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>As a follow up to my <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/functors-in-haskell.html">previous post</a>&nbsp;on Functors, it's a natural progression for me to do a post on the more advanced version, the Applicative Functor. In a normal functor, you'll map a function over a functor and applicative functor is a reverse view of this where it'll allow you to map many functor values over a single function.</div><div><br /></div><h3>What is an Applicative Functor?</h3><div>At the code level, an Applicative Functor is any type that is in instance of the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#t:Applicative">Applicative</a>&nbsp;typeclass. At a concept level, the Applicative Functor has not only the values in "a context" but also the function that we'll apply is in a context. This differs from just a normal Functor (<a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/functors-in-haskell.html">read more here</a>) where it's only the value that's wrapped in a context.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>An <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#t:Applicative">Applicative Functor</a>&nbsp;has 2 functions that require implementation. <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:pure">pure</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>. This typeclass and functions are defined as follows.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4589744.js"></script></div><div><br />The definition for&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:pure">pure</a>&nbsp;on Hoogle suggests that it will<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Lift a value</i></blockquote>"Lifting" is very well described in articles all over the web. Here's the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lifting">Haskell Wiki's article</a>&nbsp;on Lifting.&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:pure">pure</a>&nbsp;takes in a value and returns an applicative value around that value. It's actually quite a simple definition when you read it.<br /><br />The other function defined here is&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>. &nbsp;The definition for&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>&nbsp;on Hoolgle suggests that it will perform<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Sequential application</i></blockquote>The definition of sequential application here can be expanded such that&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>&nbsp;takes a function <b>(a -&gt; b)&nbsp;</b>wrapped up in a functor&nbsp;<b>f</b> and another functor value <b>f a</b>. It'll extract the function from the first parameter <b>(a -&gt; b)</b>, map it over the functor value <b>f a</b>&nbsp;to produce a result <b>f b</b>.<br /><br />The concept is very similar to what we've seen before in mapping scenarios, it's just that we "map" with different "things". Today we're mapping with functor values over a function.<br /><br /><h3>Pure</h3>Here's some examples of&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:pure">pure</a>&nbsp;in action. You'll see that when we're casting to a type, we receive the appropriate value back<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">&gt; pure "Hey" :: Maybe String<br />Just "Hey"<br /><br />&gt; pure "Should be in a List" :: [String]<br />["Should be in a List"]<br /></pre><br />You can see here that the value is "lifted" by&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:pure">pure</a>&nbsp;into the container (in this case either a Maybe or a List).<br /><br /><h3>&lt;*&gt;</h3>For the next set of examples, I'll show you some usages of &nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>. You'll need to keep in the front of your mind that all functions on the left hand side are applied to all values on the right hand side, so we end up with a&nbsp;Cartesian&nbsp;effect.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">&gt; [sin, cos, tan] &lt;*&gt; [pi, pi, pi]<br />[1.2246467991473532e-16,1.2246467991473532e-16,1.2246467991473532e-16,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.2246467991473532e-16,-1.2246467991473532e-16,-1.2246467991473532e-16]<br /></pre><br />The&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>&nbsp;function is left associable, so when you start chaining calls together it's the leftmost that is evaluated first.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">&gt; [(+),(*)] &lt;*&gt; [1,2] &lt;*&gt; [3,4]<br />[4,5,5,6,3,4,6,8]<br /><br />(which is really)<br />[1+3,1+4,2+3,2+4,1*3,1*4,2*3,2*4]</pre><div><br /><h3>Applicative Style</h3>You can see how using this "applicative style" in code can often be swapped 1-for-1 with list comprehensions as you achieve the same permuted or&nbsp;Cartesian&nbsp;effect. Take this for example.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">&gt; [salutation ++ name | salutation &lt;- ["Hello ", "Goodbye ", "Yo! "], name &lt;- ["John", "Mary", "Anne"]]<br />["Hello John","Hello Mary","Hello Anne","Goodbye John","Goodbye Mary","Goodbye Anne","Yo! John","Yo! Mary","Yo! Anne"]<br /><br />&gt; (++) &lt;$&gt; ["Hello ", "GoodBye ", "Yo! "] &lt;*&gt; ["John", "Mary", "Anne"]<br />["Hello John","Hello Mary","Hello Anne","Goodbye John","Goodbye Mary","Goodbye Anne","Yo! John","Yo! Mary","Yo! Anne"]<br /></pre><br />You can see that when dealing with lists, the following is true:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">pure f &lt;*&gt; xs == fmap f xs</pre><br />In this context, "pure f" is putting f into a list. "[f] &lt;*&gt; xs" just applies each function in the left list to the right.<br /><br />Another implementation of the Applicative Functor that doesn't follow the same notion of a List is its use with IO. The idea of the applicative functor still holds, but when dealing with IO its the actions that are operated on. This can be thought of in the same way as sequencing and mapping in one.<br /><br /><h3>ZipList</h3>Another type that is an instance of&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#t:Applicative">Applicative</a>&nbsp;is the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:ZipList">ZipList</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:ZipList">ZipList</a>&nbsp;type is defined as follows.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4591634.js"></script> <br />When we use applicative style on a normal list, we end up with a Cartesian product of the two lists involved. A&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:ZipList">ZipList</a>&nbsp;differs here by operating on indicies in either list that are the same. Index [0] on the left gets applied to Index [0] on the right. Index [1] on the left gets applied to Index [1] on the right, and so on.<br /><br /><h3>Applicative Functor Laws</h3><div>Finally, there are a few laws that applicative functors must abide by, they are as follows.</div><div><div><ul><li><pre>pure id &lt;*&gt; v = v</pre></li><li><pre>pure (.) &lt;*&gt; u &lt;*&gt; v &lt;*&gt; w = u &lt;*&gt; (v &lt;*&gt; w)</pre></li><li><pre>pure f &lt;*&gt; pure x = pure (f x)</pre></li><li><pre>u &lt;*&gt; pure y = pure ($ y) &lt;*&gt; u</pre></li></ul></div></div><br /><h3>Applying applicative functors for yourself</h3><div>This has been a very difficult topic that I've burnt some time on as late. There are plenty of examples of how this knowledge has been applied for a List or Maybe, but I've struggled to apply this to a type of my own. So far though, I've come across <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Applicative_Functors">this article on Applicative Functors</a> on the Hakell Wiki and most notably this sentence:</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">Anytime you feel the need to define different higher order functions to accommodate for function-arguments with a different number of arguments, think about how defining a proper instance of Applicative can make your life easier.</blockquote>That to me makes sense. So, if you have a function that operates on a particular type and you'd like to apply that function to "n" arguments - you'd normally create an fmap clone that would cater for that many arguments. Using an applicative functor, the re-creation of the fmap instance goes away as your higher-order function can expect any number of arguments.<br /><br />Because of this, the following is true.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4601255.js"></script> That's it for today's post. I hope to update this post with some more examples and information as I discover it!</div></div></div>

    <h1>Building a Tree</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>Following up from a <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/basic-lexical-analysis-in-c.html">previous post</a>&nbsp;I had written on lexical analysis, I wanted to take you through the conversion of a list of scanned items into a tree that will become of more use once we start to compile to executable instructions.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Why a tree?</h3><div>When you look at a sequence of scanned items that come out of the lexer, its one-dimensional structure doesn't allow you to apply precedence easily. A tree structure lends itself very well to this problem exactly. See the following example. First, I'll give you an expression and then I'll (try) to put a tree together from said expression.</div><div><br /><pre class="brush:plain">As an expression:<br />(x &gt; 5) &amp;&amp; ((y &lt; 3) || (z &gt;= 6))<br /><br />As a tree:<br /><br />                 &amp;&amp;<br />               /    \<br />             /        \<br />            &gt;         ||<br />           / \       /  \<br />          x   5     &lt;    &gt;=<br />                   / \   / \<br />                  y   3 z  6 <br /></pre></div><div><br />I do appologise for my ASCII art, but you get the idea. We now have an order of&nbsp;precedence&nbsp;as we move from the root (or the top) of the tree down through the branches until we reach the leaf nodes which end up as our values that we're testing.<br /><br /><h3>Making the list into a tree</h3></div><div>We have a list of scanned items on one hand, we need to make it a tree. These (tree-related) problems lend themselves really well to recursive solutions, and you'll see this pop up quite a bit when working with tree structures. Here's how we define a node within the tree (which is actually how we'll refer to the tree overall).</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4583311.js"></script></div><div><br />Pretty easy and illustrative of the tree above. We have information "here" and we have further trees "left" and "right". The generation process is pretty straight forward. You need to keep in mind the following though:<br /><br /><ul><li>New scope (or a left paren) means we need to recurse a level deeper</li><li>End of scope (or a right paren) means we need to drop out to get back to a level above in the recursion stack</li><li>Any operator is just the value "here"</li></ul><div>Three simple rules all wrapped up in the crux of a switch statement here.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4583314.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div>This code is commented fairly well. It's a pretty straight forward concept anyway. From here you should have no trouble translating the expression tree which we've just generated into your own programs execution paradigms.</div><div><br />The source code that these articles are based upon is available in my <a href="https://github.com/tuttlem/">GitHub repository</a> in a project called <a href="https://github.com/tuttlem/Umpire">Umpire</a>.</div></div></div>

    <h1>Basic Lexical Analysis in C#</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>Creating your own languages can be a fun challenge at times, it can also be a very intimidating beast if you don't break the problems down into small enough sub-problems. Each step of the compilation process is as important as the rest, so today's post is going to be about performing basic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis">Lexical Analysis</a>&nbsp;to tokenize your input.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Mission parameters</h3><div>We'll be designing a language that looks very similar to C-style boolean logic. It'll basically be an "if-statement machine" that we'll have in the end. The sorts of code strings that we'll look to analyse will be something like this.</div><div><br /><pre class="brush:plain">// numeric value comparison<br />4 &lt; 7<br /><br />// logic concatenation and scope<br />(4 &lt; 7) &amp;&amp; ((9 &gt;= 7) || (10 != 2))<br /><br />// string matching<br />"Hello" ~ "Hello, World"<br /></pre></div><div><br /></div><div>You can see how these will become quite complex quite quickly but that's not for us to worry about now. All we want to worry about is encountering items of interest in our strings and producing a list of tokens that we've found.<br /><br /><h3>Scanning the string</h3></div><div>"Things of interest" is what I called it above. The things of interest are say, the numeric values or the strings or the logical operator or the expression operators. When we want to interpret strings, we call on our friend Mr. Regular Expression.</div><div><br /></div><div>First thing I've done is to load an array with regular expressions matching the "things of interest" and generating a token for each of these.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4581991.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div>For every regular expression, you can see that I've assigned a symbolic token. That way we can scan a string and get a "hard-reference" to something of interest that we need to do something with. Scanning a string is just iterating over the characters, finding a regular expression match and adding it to the list.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4582060.js"></script> <br />By this point, we're either handed back a list of "ScanItem" objects that describes for us what our code is and looks like or an exception is thrown complaining about syntax problems. We can further use this list to start building expression trees to execute.<br /><br />The code in the article is based on a project that I'm currently working on called Umpire. The source code can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/tuttlem/Umpire/">GitHub repository</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

    <h1>Migrating from bash to zsh on OSX</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>There's plenty of shells around these days to try out and see what fits. I've forever used bash and have become quite accustomed to it in day to day usage. I've heard plenty of murmurs around the use of zsh and how all of my bash skills would translate directly but I would get some extra added benefits.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's time for me to dive in!&nbsp;This post is to take you through a migration process from bash to zsh. I expect that this post will grow over time.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Installation</h3><div>I'll assume that you're using <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">brew</a>&nbsp;in your installation of OSX just to lower the level of insanity of your life.</div><div><br /></div><div>Type the following in your shell to get zsh installed.</div><div><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ brew install zsh</pre></div><div></div><br />Next, you'll need to register it as an acceptable shell for OSX to use, so to do this add a line referencing your newly installed zsh to your /etc/shells file. Here's how mine looks, my new entry was added to the bottom.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain"># List of acceptable shells for chpass(1).<br /># Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using<br /># one of these shells.<br /><br />/bin/bash<br />/bin/csh<br />/bin/ksh<br />/bin/sh<br />/bin/tcsh<br />/bin/zsh<br />/usr/local/bin/zsh<br /></pre><br />When brew installed zsh for me, it also reported that there was some extra administration that needed to happen. It said:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">If you have administrator privileges, you must fix an Apple missconfiguration in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion by renaming /etc/zshenv to/etc/zprofile, or Zsh will have the wrong PATH when executednon-interactively by scripts. <br /><br />Alternatively, install Zsh with /etc disabled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;brew install --disable-etcdir zsh </blockquote>So, I just renamed /etc/zshenv to /etc/zprofile with the following command to comply.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ sudo mv /etc/zshenv /etc/zprofile</pre><br />Now you can register zsh as the default shell for OSX with the following command.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh</pre><br />Fantastic. Close your terminal and reopen a new one - you're now in zsh.<br /><br /><h3>Kickstart</h3><div>To drop yourself "right in it", head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a>&nbsp;repository and get yourself some theming happening.&nbsp;The installation instructions over there are very straight forward, and you'll go from % sign to something spectacular in no time at all.</div></div>

    <h1>Enable ATI Drivers in Debian x64</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3>Today's post, I'll run through the procedures that I've just conducted to get AMD ATI drivers running on my T400 in Debian.<br /><br /><h3>Doing easily with "non-free"</h3>To save myself a few manual installation steps, I ended up just enabling non-free on my repositories. In order to do this, open up /etc/apt/sources.list and for your main repository line (which will look something similar to this)<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib</pre><br />Just add "non-free" into repositories that you need, like so.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free</pre><br />After performing any changes to your sources list, it's always an idea to update your package lists with the following command.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ sudo aptitude update</pre><br /><h3>Installing the driver</h3>After you've enabled "non-free" on your repository, installation is a piece of cake. Remove the existing radeon driver from your system like so.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ sudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg-video-radeon</pre><br />Install the new drivers and associated utilities.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ sudo apt-get install fglrx-driver fglrx-control fglrx-glx fglrx-atieventsd fglrx-modules-dkms</pre><br />Be sure to install 32-bit support for your 32-bit applications as well.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ sudo apt-get install fglrx-glx-ia32</pre><br /><h3>Finishing up</h3>A minor amount of housekeeping is required to enable the driver for use. First up, the module that we've just installed needs to be enabled at boot. To do this, I've added "fglrx" to my /etc/modules file. The /etc/modules file on my Debian laptop reads like this.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain"># /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.<br />#<br /># This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded<br /># at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.<br /># Parameters can be specified after the module name.<br /><br />fglrx<br />firewire-sbp2<br />loop<br /></pre><br />Finally, X needs to be to told that you want to use the fglrx driver. This is pretty simple, by setting your "Driver" to "fglrx" in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf. For reference, here is my config.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">Section "ServerLayout"<br /> Identifier     "aticonfig Layout"<br /> Screen      0  "aticonfig-Screen[0]-0" 0 0<br />EndSection<br /><br />Section "Module"<br />EndSection<br /><br />Section "Monitor"<br /> Identifier   "aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0"<br /> Option     "VendorName" "ATI Proprietary Driver"<br /> Option     "ModelName" "Generic Autodetecting Monitor"<br /> Option     "DPMS" "true"<br />EndSection<br /><br />Section "Device"<br /> Identifier  "aticonfig-Device[0]-0"<br /> Driver      "fglrx"<br /> BusID       "PCI:1:0:0"<br />EndSection<br /><br />Section "Screen"<br /> Identifier "aticonfig-Screen[0]-0"<br /> Device     "aticonfig-Device[0]-0"<br /> Monitor    "aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0"<br /> DefaultDepth     24<br /> SubSection "Display"<br />  Viewport   0 0<br />  Depth     24<br /> EndSubSection<br />EndSection<br /></pre><br />You should have no problems wowing all your friends with crazy window composition now! </div>
