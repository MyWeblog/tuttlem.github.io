[H2](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) is a [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system) written entirely in Java. It has an extremely small footprint and has an in-memory mode making it an excellent choice for embedded applications.

In today's post, I'll take you through using the H2 shell.

### Shell

Once you've downloaded H2 from their site, you can get a database created and running using the shell. You can invoke the shell with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
java -cp h2-1.4.190.jar org.h2.tools.Shell -url jdbc:h2:~/testdb
{% endhighlight %}

I'm using version `1.4.190` here. The `-url` command line directs us to the file of the database that we'll create/open.

Once the shell is running, you're presented with a `sql>` prompt. You can start creating your table definitions. The documentation on the website is quite extensive with the supported [sql grammar](http://www.h2database.com/html/grammar.html), [functions](http://www.h2database.com/html/functions.html) and [data types](http://www.h2database.com/html/datatypes.html).

### Further development

Now that you've created a database, you can write java applications using JDBC to run queries against your H2 database.
