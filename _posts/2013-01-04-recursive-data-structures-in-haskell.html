<h3>Introduction</h3><div>As I've been following along in <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a>, I've been coming across some really interesting material around the type system. In today's post, I want to walk through the Tree data type that they define in this book for the section on recursive data structures.</div><div><br /></div><h3>What it is?</h3><div>A recursive data structure is a type that has itself as a type amongst its fields. Pretty wild idea, but really useful for situations of Child-&gt;Parent, Tree-&gt;Leaf, etc. In today's example we're going to be using the Tree structure which looks like this.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4447497.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>This data type reads as, a "Tree" can either be an EmptyTree or it can have two nodes (that are also trees). You can start to see that this would be a best-fit as a binary search tree. Using an instance of Functor, we can give the the Tree data type&nbsp;recursively&nbsp;iterative&nbsp;properties through fmap.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4447642.js"></script> <br /><h3>Using the type</h3></div><div>Getting data into the tree is done cleverly (or so I think) with some basic pattern matching. I think it's done cleverly because it reads so well/humanly (perhaps I'm easily pleased).<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4447669.js"></script> <br />Inserting an EmptyTree node will result in a node with an EmptyTree either side.&nbsp;Inserting data for key that exists will overwrite the existing data. Inserting a lesser key (lesser according to Ord) will put the node on the left, greater onto the right.<br /><br />Actually building a tree can be as simple as the following.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4447713.js"></script> <br />This results in a tree that looks like this.<br /><br /><pre>*Main&gt; fmap (*1) (foldr treeInsert EmptyTree [5,7,3])<br />Node 3 EmptyTree (Node 7 (Node 5 EmptyTree EmptyTree) EmptyTree)</pre><br />3 is at the trunk with no left-hand-side. 3's right hand side has a 7 with 5 for its left hand side and no right hand sides (for 5 or 7). Reading the dump out from ghci is going to be better for your understanding than trying to read my English describing the tree's structure.<br /><br />The important part that I wanted to illustrate really was the use of fmap here. We map the function (*1) so that none of the values in our source array change. We apply "treeInsert" in a fold-right starting with EmptyTree across the source array [5,7,3].<br /><br />If you ask me, that's pretty cool.<br /><br /></div></div>
