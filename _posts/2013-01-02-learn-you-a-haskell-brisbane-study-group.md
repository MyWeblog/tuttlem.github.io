As a bit of a bookmark to myself, I wanted to make mention of a study group that an [old colleague](http://morenews.blogspot.com.au/) had brought to my attention.

The [wiki](https://github.com/learnhaskell-brisbane/learn/wiki) that has been put up for this project has been a great source of home-work as I've gone through the book. I haven't yet made it to the end of the book but am working on it. It's been important for me to have some home work to do on this topic as I don't write Haskell professionally. Without something flexing my Haskell muscles, the knowledge tends to go on holiday rather quickly.

The [learn repository](https://github.com/learnhaskell-brisbane/learn) has all of the source code and documents for the course.
