<h3>Introduction</h3>The repository for the current stable version of Debian (squeeze) doesn't include a compiler with C++11 support. Today's post will take you through adding a testing repository so that you can get a compiler with this support in it.<br /><br />We needed to do <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/installing-haskell-platform-on-debian.html">something similar</a>&nbsp;in a previous post when we were upgrading haskell platform for Debian. This won't stray to far from that.<br /><br /><h3>The Steps</h3><div>First up, we need to enable the testing repository. Adding the following lines to /etc/apt/sources.list will do this for us.</div><div><br /><pre>deb http://mirror.to.debian.repo/debian/ wheezy main    <br />deb-src http://mirror.to.debian.repo/debian/ wheezy main</pre></div><div><br />Next, we'll add an entry into the /etc/apt/preferences file to give preference to the "squeeze" (stable) repository over "wheezy" (testing) by adding these lines.<br /><br /><pre>Package: *            <br />Pin: release n=squeeze<br />Pin-Priority: 900     <br />                      <br />Package: *            <br />Pin: release n=wheezy <br />Pin-Priority: 200</pre><br />Finally, you'll be able to install clang with the following command. Take note that we're giving the install command the switches "--target-release testing", which tells aptitude to install this unit of software and its dependencies from the testing repository.<br /><br /><pre>$ sudo aptitude update &amp;&amp; sudo aptitude upgrade<br />$ sudo aptitude --target-release testing install clang</pre><br />You're done. C++11 support on your Debian box.</div></div>
