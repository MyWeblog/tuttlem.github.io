As a bit of a bookmark to myself, I wanted to make mention of a study group that an <a href="http://morenews.blogspot.com.au/">old colleague</a>&nbsp;had brought to my attention.<br /><br />The <a href="https://github.com/learnhaskell-brisbane/learn/wiki">wiki</a>&nbsp;that has been put up for this project has been a great source of home-work as I've gone through the book. I haven't yet made it to the end of the book but am working on it. It's been important for me to have some home work to do on this topic as I don't write Haskell professionally. Without something flexing my Haskell muscles, the knowledge tends to go on holiday rather quickly.<br /><br />The <a href="https://github.com/learnhaskell-brisbane/learn">learn repository</a>&nbsp;has all of the source code and documents for the course.<br /><br /><br /></div>
