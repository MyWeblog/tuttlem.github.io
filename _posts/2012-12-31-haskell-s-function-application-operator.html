<br />Sometimes, Haskell's syntax is so alien to read (to my eyes at least anyway). I've seen wide-spread use of the "$" operator all over lots of people's code and never really had a grasp on what it is/does.<br /><div><br /></div><div>In the end, it's really quite simple.</div><div><br /></div><div>The whitespace character has a very high precedence order, so when you're using spaces the precedence order looks like this.</div><div><br /><pre>f a b c = ((f a) b) c</pre></div><div><br /></div><div>This is classified as being left-associative. In contrast, using the "$" operator allows us to be right-associative. An example.<br /><br /><pre>f $ a $ b $ c = f (a (b c))</pre><br />Looking at this, it's starting to look very much how our programming languages are structured with function calls. We're very right-associative. Because Haskell uses the white space character to denote left-associations, it takes a lot of parenthesis to make a complex state right-associative as you need to change the precedence order by hand.<br /><br />This is the true power of the "$" function. We can use the "$" to free us for parenthesising everything, so that a transformation as below occurs.<br /><br /><pre>putStrLn (show num) <br />putStrLn $ show num</pre><br />This simple scenario doesn't illustrate exactly how much the "$" operator will help us out. Here's another slightly more complex scenario. It becomes clear here that "$" is working to make our code more readable.<br /><br /><pre>sum (take 10 (cycle [1,2,3]))<br />sum $ take 10 $ cycle [1,2,3]</pre><br />In character-space length they're equivalent, but the second version looks less LISP-y. I guess this is what was being aimed at.<br /><br />Anyway, until next time.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
