<h3>Introduction</h3><div>If you do spend a bit of time writing applications in Haskell, you'll probably be writing a lot of console programs. I love writing console programs but sometimes you just want a bit of GUI. In today's post, I want to do a walkthrough of getting an application up and running with the help of Gtk Haskell bindings&nbsp;<a href="http://projects.haskell.org/gtk2hs/">Gtk2Hs</a>. The result code is actually the "Hello World" example they provide, but this should still serve as a good walkthrough.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Gtk2Hs</h3><div>As I mentioned in the introduction, we'll be using the Haskell bindings for Gtk&nbsp;<a href="http://projects.haskell.org/gtk2hs/">Gtk2Hs</a>&nbsp;to accomplish our UI. As you'd expect, it's very much like writing Gtk applications using other language bindings, only this way we get to use our functional brains to get there.</div><div><br /></div><div>Take a look through the package up on <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gtk-0.12.0">Hackage</a>&nbsp;as well as the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Gtk2Hs">Wiki Article</a> about the library. This should give even the uninitiated a bit of the background story behind the library.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Project Setup</h3><div>Start a new project in the usual fashion with cabal.</div><div><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ mkdir guitest<br />$ cd guitest<br />$ touch LICENSE<br />$ cabal init<br /></pre></div><div><br />There are quite a list of dependencies to use the package "gtk" as listed on the&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gtk-0.12.0">Hackage</a>&nbsp;page. One dependency is that you need to have "gtk2hs-buildtools" installed. Get these installed into your project with the following command.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ cabal-dev install gtk2hs-buildtools</pre><br />Now that you've installed these tools, you'll need to get them on your path so that they are available at compile time. You can do this with the following command.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ export PATH=~/projdir/cabal-dev/bin:$PATH</pre><br />The other requirements which might just be localised to my environment (OSX 10.8) is that I needed to make pkg-config aware of the "pc" files for X11. I did this simply by running the following command.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig/</pre><br />Finally for dependencies is making your project file aware of the dependencies on the application. As I mentioned before, there are a few and these just get listed under your "build-depends" attribute in your cabal project file. Here's how mine looks.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">build-depends:       base ==4.5.*,   <br />                     gtk ==0.12.4,   <br />                     cairo ==0.12.4, <br />                     glib ==0.12.4,  <br />                     pango ==0.12.4, <br />                     gio ==0.12.4    </pre><br /><br />Create a new file in your project called "Test.hs" and add the following code. This code is very simple. It opens a window, adds a button (with an event handler attached) and that's about it.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/4744834.js"></script> <br />This code is pretty straight forward and it almost reads like english so you can see exactly what it's doing.<br /><br />Now that we have a main module, it's time to tell our project file that it exists and that it's where we'll find our "main" function. You do this by setting the "main-is" attribute to this file's name "Test.hs" in your cabal file.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">main-is:             Test.hs</pre><br /><h3>Build and Run</h3></div><div>It's time to give this bad boy a go. This first build will feel like it's taking forever, but it'll only be on the first time while cabal-dev gets all of the dependencies together and builds them. Subsequent builds will be much quicker.</div><div><br /></div><div>Build your project with the following command.</div><div><br /><pre class="brush: shell">$ cabal-dev install</pre></div><div><br />Go and make a coffee, then another one .. do all of your shopping, come back ... aaannnnndd ....<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Mz5UA3upxBM/URYw0pKxg_I/AAAAAAAAAmQ/DoK8SkCl4YM/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-02-09+at+9.18.58+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Mz5UA3upxBM/URYw0pKxg_I/AAAAAAAAAmQ/DoK8SkCl4YM/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-02-09+at+9.18.58+PM.png" /></a></div>You end up with a rather unimpressive (but working) gtk application! Well, there's still more to learn on this topic, this is only the start.</div></div>
