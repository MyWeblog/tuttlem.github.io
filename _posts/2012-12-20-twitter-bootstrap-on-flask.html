I really like the simplicity of a micro-framework for web applications. No fluff, no messing around with junk you just don't need when you're trying to stay focused on what counts - logic.<br /><br />To ease this project startup phase even more, I've added a new project template to my templates repository on <a href="https://github.com/tuttlem/templates">github</a> that gets the&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>&nbsp;web template up and running within a&nbsp;<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>&nbsp;application.<br /><br />Check it out if you get a chance.</div>
