<h3>Introduction</h3><div>This post is just a small write up on the differences between these three keywords and their uses within Haskell.</div><div><br /></div><h3>type</h3><div>Using the "type" keyword is the same as just referring to the actual type that you've declared. In other words, "type" just lets you make a synonym for the original type.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4613925.js"></script></div><div>Using these, we'll be able to refer to a Card list as a Deck. They can be used&nbsp;interchangeably as they'll directly cast. All this really does for us, is gives a pre-existing type a more meaningful name to our code.<br /><h3>newtype</h3></div><div>Using the "newtype" keyword, we make a thin wrapper around an existing type. Something that will be treated differently at compile time, but will be directly translatable (and not subject to conversion) at runtime.&nbsp;</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4599121.js"></script></div><div><br />"newtype" only allows you one constructor and one field. It's important that its used when you're creating data entries that have these constraints on them. These attributes make "newtype" a great candidate for when you just want to add a typeclass instance to an existing type.<br /><br /><h3>data</h3></div><div>The "data" keyword allows you to build much more complex types. With the "data" keyword, you can have as many constructors and fields as you like.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4614176.js"></script></div><div>Of course, it would make more sense to use "record syntax" when defining these datatypes above.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4614325.js"></script> <h3>Wrapping up</h3></div><div><ul><li>Use "type" to give your types more meaningful names</li><li>Use "newtype" if you just want to take an existing type and add a typeclass instance to it</li><li>Use "data" if you want to create your own datatype</li></ul></div></div>
