    <h1>bash_profile vs bashrc</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3>Whenever I need to make shell configuration changes in unix land (weather that be on a linux, bsd or osx box), I always find myself scratching around trying to find the "correct place" to put the changes that I want to make. This post is all about the black and white between <i>.bash_profile</i> and <i>.bashrc.</i><br /><h3></h3><h3>The documented difference</h3><div>If you were to read the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/bash">bash man page</a>&nbsp;you'll get two pretty clear sentences in there.</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.</blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc, if that file exists.&nbsp;</blockquote>From this, you can see the deciding factor is:<br /><ul><li>If it's a login shell, use <i>.bash_profile</i></li><li>If it's <b><u>not</u></b> a login shell, use <i>.bashrc</i></li></ul><h3></h3><h3>What's a login shell?</h3><div>A login shell is when you're logging into the machine at the console or over SSH i.e. you haven't yet logged in.</div><div><br /></div><div>A non-login shell is, for example, when you've already logged into your window manager and you fire up your terminal (that is of course, if your terminal is configured to run as a non-login shell!).</div><div><br /></div><div>Caveats and configurations aside, this is the coarse difference between terms.</div><h3></h3><h3>Ok, which one do I bloody use then?</h3><div>Well, to save yourself some administration headaches why not just use one? You then "source" that configuration file from the other. I know that doesn't read very well, so here's the example. I hope this makes it clearer.</div><div><br /></div><div>So, fill <i>.bashrc </i>with all of your configuration goodies and put the following into <i>.bash_profile</i></div><br /><pre class="brush:shell;">if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then<br />   source ~/.bashrc<br />fi</pre><br />So now it doesn't matter if you use a login or non-login shell, you get the same, consistent configuration experience!<br /><br /></div>

    <h1>Using python from the safety of your virtualenv on Debian</h1>
<div class='post'>
I like having my specific development environments setup, tailored for the particular project that I'm working on. When I'm working on a python project, <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a> is my go to tool for the job. It's great.<br /><br />We're going to install this using easy_install so that these instructions should translate pretty well to any linux environment. I am doing this from my Debian workstation though.<br /><br />First up, we need to install the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/python-setuptools">python-setuptools</a> package so that we get access to easy_install.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell;">sudo apt-get install python-setuptools</pre><br />Next we install&nbsp;<a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>&nbsp;with easy_install<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell;">sudo easy_install virtualenv</pre><br />As far as the installation is considered, you're done! It's that easy.<br /><br />From here you can start to use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>&nbsp;for all of your python based projects. I'll do a quick cheat-sheet write up shortly on how to use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>&nbsp;at a glance.</div>

    <h1>Turn off that pc speaker in Debian!</h1>
<div class='post'>
Only a short post. The <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki">ThinkWiki</a> has a great little <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_disable_the_pc_speaker_(beep!)">write-up</a>&nbsp;on disabling the pc speaker device under Debian linux. I thought I'd just shortcut the details in this post.<br /><br />Remove the pc speaker module<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell;">sudo modprobe -r pcspkr snd_pcsp</pre><br />Remove the pc speaker permanently<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell;"># the following lines need to be added to<br /># the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf<br /><br /># make sure you find out which device you actually have<br />blacklist pcspkr<br />blacklist snd_pcsp<br /></pre><br />Anyway, these are just the details to disable the device. The ThinkWiki article has some other ideas also on how to make the bell tone tolerable. Not for me though. I can't stand it.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <h1>Windows Development with MASM32 (part 5)</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>Welcome to the fifth instalment in the series on writing windows applications using MASM32. We've covered the basics pretty thoroughly in parts <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/windows-development-with-masm32-part-1.html">1</a>, <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/windows-development-with-masm32-part-2.html">2</a> and <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/windows-development-with-masm32-part-3.html">3</a>. We took a bit of a left turn for part <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/windows-development-with-masm32-part-4.html">4</a>&nbsp;covering double buffering which admittedly is a bit of an advanced topic.</div><div><br /></div><div>We're back on the straight and narrow now - today we're going to discuss common controls.<br />&nbsp;</div><h3>What are they?</h3><div><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb775493(v=vs.85).aspx">Window common controls</a>&nbsp;are served out of a dll called Comctl32.dll. The fill list can be found <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773169(v=vs.85).aspx">here</a>&nbsp;and there's heaps in there: toolbar, tooltip, status bar, property sheet, treeview, trackbar, the list goes on.<br />&nbsp;</div><h3>Show me!</h3><div>Today, we're just going to create a simple, humble, <strong><u>common</u></strong> status bar for our window. First up, we need to import another header and library. Nicely enough these are named comctl32.inc and comctl32.lib respectively.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4285388.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div>Next up we have a touch of initialization to get the library in gear. This is just a one-liner.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4285408.js"></script><br />So, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb775695(VS.85).aspx">InitCommonControls</a>&nbsp;just initializes the window classes involved in using common controls. Now we'll use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632619(v=vs.85).aspx">WM_CREATE</a> message in the window procedure to actually create our child controls. In our case today, it's just going to be the status window. So, we'll use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb760762(v=vs.85).aspx">CreateStatusWindow</a>.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4285572.js"></script><br /><br />We can fire our application up now and see our statusbar in all its glory at the bottom of the window. This isn't really enough though. I really need to show you how to put something in the status window. A good case here, I think is just some text. I'm sure that you will find much more useful things to do with this, but for this purposes of this post, when a user clicks in the window area with their left mouse button, I'm going to put the string "Click!" into the status bar.<br /><br />Note the use of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644950(v=vs.85).aspx">SendMessage</a>. This is how we'll instruct all of our UI objects to do things of interest for us. Sending messages is how we all co-operate in windows land.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4285606.js"></script><br />So, that's it for a very tip-of-the-ice-berg (and it's a massive one) look at common controls.</div></div>
