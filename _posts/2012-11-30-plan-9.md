Bell Labs look like they've just opened up a little more of their source-code in the shape of some system commands.

* [http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sources/plan9/sys/src/cmd/](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sources/plan9/sys/src/cmd/)

It's worth a browse just to have a look at how some of these things were implemented.

A quick update, seems that someone has [Plan9 running on a raspberry PI](http://bendyworks.com/geekville/lab_projects/2012/11/getting-plan-9-running-on-the-raspberry-pi).
