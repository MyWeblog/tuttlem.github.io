<h1>Pygame Part 1 The Window</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>It's easy to be productive when you've got good tools. I've forever been building game engines in an attempt that I'll actually put it to use one day to write a game. The constant distraction is adding just the "1 feature more" which in turn ends up stopping you from actually writing a game. It's time to look for help.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> is exactly what someone like me needs to squeeze the excuses. With a fully-featured game library, there's no more needing to build the library - all you need to do is be productive writing your game!</div><div><br /></div><div>I hope to put together a handful of tutorials that I can come back to at anytime and already have a head start.&nbsp;These tutorials will assume that you already have a pygame environment up and running. There's plenty of tutorials around the traps already to get you on your way, I've even done one for OSX <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/pygame-virtualenv-pip-homebrew.html">here</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>To start off, today's tutorial will do nothing more than get a window on screen, repeatedly painting black.</div><div><br /></div><h3>The code</h3><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/4970913.js"></script> You can see here that getting a window up and running is very straight forward. We initialise the framework, setup the display and start painting.<br /><br />All going well, if you run this code from your console, you should end up with something like this.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-da79gYox4Lo/USCxara_UzI/AAAAAAAAAmg/N4XkUsss3ss/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-02-17+at+8.30.28+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="277" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-da79gYox4Lo/USCxara_UzI/AAAAAAAAAmg/N4XkUsss3ss/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-02-17+at+8.30.28+PM.png" width="320" /></a></div>That's it. Couldn't be easier!<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
