    <h1>Pygame Part 1 The Window</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>It's easy to be productive when you've got good tools. I've forever been building game engines in an attempt that I'll actually put it to use one day to write a game. The constant distraction is adding just the "1 feature more" which in turn ends up stopping you from actually writing a game. It's time to look for help.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> is exactly what someone like me needs to squeeze the excuses. With a fully-featured game library, there's no more needing to build the library - all you need to do is be productive writing your game!</div><div><br /></div><div>I hope to put together a handful of tutorials that I can come back to at anytime and already have a head start.&nbsp;These tutorials will assume that you already have a pygame environment up and running. There's plenty of tutorials around the traps already to get you on your way, I've even done one for OSX <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/pygame-virtualenv-pip-homebrew.html">here</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>To start off, today's tutorial will do nothing more than get a window on screen, repeatedly painting black.</div><div><br /></div><h3>The code</h3><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/4970913.js"></script> You can see here that getting a window up and running is very straight forward. We initialise the framework, setup the display and start painting.<br /><br />All going well, if you run this code from your console, you should end up with something like this.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-da79gYox4Lo/USCxara_UzI/AAAAAAAAAmg/N4XkUsss3ss/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-02-17+at+8.30.28+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="277" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-da79gYox4Lo/USCxara_UzI/AAAAAAAAAmg/N4XkUsss3ss/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-02-17+at+8.30.28+PM.png" width="320" /></a></div>That's it.

    <h1>Bootstrap your NASM programs with NASMX</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3>I'd been looking over the past couple of nights for a way that I could simplify the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">syscall interface</a> from NASM's perspective, just so I could clean up a lot of code that filled registers directly. I made a start on a couple of prototype projects, but never even thought to look outside and find out if someone had done the same.<br /><br />"Surely, someone has been here before", I thought!<br /><br /><h3>NASMX</h3><div>Yes, someone has been here before! <a href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/projects/nasmx/">NASMX</a>&nbsp;is a collection of include files specifically designed to wrap all of this system call code&nbsp;intuitively&nbsp;into a rather nicely presentable interface. Their <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nasmx/">SourceForge project page</a>&nbsp;doesn't contain much documentation, but once you download the library you'll also receive a handful of demonstration programs using the library.</div><div><br /></div><h3>An example</h3><div>First of all, you include the required header files.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/4956583.js"></script></div><div><br /></div>Next, like any decent "Hello World" application you declare the data you require.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/4956598.js"></script> <br />Finally, the application call looks very human (for assembly language)<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/4956613.js"></script> <br />That's it! The code above is not my own, I've just dissected the "Hello World" example that comes in the library's zip package.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <h1>64bit ABI Cheatsheet</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>Using a few different articles around the web, I thought it might be a good idea to aggregate all of the information around calling conventions in 64bit land. This could come in handy when wanting to write a cross OS compliant library at the assembly level.</div><div><br /></div><div>This particular article will directly target the assembly programming layer so that topics like C++ name mangling and caller clean-up are removed from its scope.</div><h3>References</h3><div>x86 calling conventions</div><div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions</a></div><div><br /></div><div>x86-64.org documentation</div><div><a href="http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/">http://www.x86-64.org/documentation/</a></div><div><br /></div><div>Mac OSX 64 bit Assembly System Calls</div><div><a href="http://thexploit.com/secdev/mac-os-x-64-bit-assembly-system-calls/">http://thexploit.com/secdev/mac-os-x-64-bit-assembly-system-calls/</a></div><div><br /></div><h3>Microsoft</h3><div>Windows will use <b>RCX</b>, <b>RDX</b>, <b>R8 </b>and <b>R9 </b>for the first four integer or pointer arguments. <b>XMM0</b>, <b>XMM1</b>, <b>XMM2 </b>and <b>XMM3 </b>are used for floating point arguments. Additional arguments are passed via the stack (right to left).</div><div><br /></div><div>An integer or pointer return value will be returned in <b>RAX</b>. Floating point return will be in <b>XMM0</b>.</div><div><br /></div><h3>System V</h3><div>System V operating systems will use <b>RDI</b>, <b>RSI</b>, <b>RDX</b>, <b>RCX</b>, <b>R8 </b>and <b>R9</b>. <b>XMM0</b>, <b>XMM1</b>, <b>XMM2</b>, <b>XMM3</b>, <b>XMM4</b>, <b>XMM5</b>, <b>XMM6 </b>and <b>XMM7 </b>will be used to pass floating point parameters. <b>RAX </b>will hold the syscall number. Additional arguments are passed via the stack (right to left).</div><div><br /></div><div>Return values are sent back via <b>RAX</b>.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Syscall Numbers</h3><div>It's interesting to note the structure of the syscall number when it comes time to execute. Looking at <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-792.13.8/osfmk/mach/i386/syscall_sw.h">syscall_sw.h</a>, you'll see that apple machines want a 2 in the higher-order double word such that the "write" syscall, normally passed as 0x04 would be passed as 0x2000004 in OSX.</div><div><br /></div><div>That's it for today. Just a cheat sheet really.</div><div><br /></div></div>

    <h1>Working with Audio in Haskell (Part 1)</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing">Digital signal processing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_signal_processing">audio processing</a>&nbsp;and the like are all rather complex topics of study. I have a personal interest in these fields as I try to create guitar processing effects from time to time. Today's post is all about taking the first steps in getting our hands on some audio and associated information from within Haskell.</div><div><br /></div><h3>hsndfile</h3><div>For today's post, I'll be using the library <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hsndfile">hsndfile</a>&nbsp;to do all of the heavy lifting as far as opening audio files and interpreting information. The files that we'll work with will need to be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV">wave format</a>. The demonstration in this post will simply open an audio file, read some information about the file and then close the file.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Project setup</h3><div>I've created a Haskell project using cabal so that I can manage the hsndfile dependency locally to this application. You may already have this installed globally on your system, but if you follow along here, you should have it installed to your project in not time.</div><div><br /></div><div>Setup your project as usual:</div><div><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ mkdir sndtest<br />$ cd sndtest<br />$ touch LICENSE<br />$ cabal init<br /></pre></div><div><br />Just select all of the defaults when setting up your project (well, that's what I did, anyway).<br /><br />We need to add&nbsp;<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Hsndfile">hsndfile</a>&nbsp;as a dependency to our project, so we'll specify this in our "sndtest.cabal" file. Open it up and make sure that your "build-depends" reads as follows.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">build-depends:         base ==4.5.*,<br />                       hsndfile ==0.5.3<br /></pre><br />Of course, you may have some different version of base, but here's where I was at anyway.<br /><br />Create a new file in your project called "Test.hs". We'll now fill out this file with the code that will open a file, read its information, close the file and then display the information to screen.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/4743448.js"></script> <br />This is pretty straight forward. First up, we import "Sound.File.SndFile" qualified as "SF" so we know when we're using something from this import.<br /><br />Dissecting the main function, firstly we open the file using <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/hsndfile/latest/doc/html/Sound-File-Sndfile.html#v:openFile">openFile</a>. This function expects the path to the audio file (in this case we're using "test.wav" which by the way you'll have to find something), we're only reading from the file at the moment so we specify <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/hsndfile/latest/doc/html/Sound-File-Sndfile.html#v:ReadMode">ReadMode</a>&nbsp;and finally we have the info parameter which is useful to us when we're writing a new file (so we can tell it what format to write in, etc), but for reading we just use <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/hsndfile/latest/doc/html/Sound-File-Sndfile.html#v:defaultInfo">defaultInfo</a>.<br /><br />We now read the stream information about the file using <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/hsndfile/latest/doc/html/Sound-File-Sndfile.html#v:hInfo">hInfo</a>, the result of which will give us back a value of type <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/hsndfile/latest/doc/html/Sound-File-Sndfile.html#t:Info">Info</a>. This info packet tells us the number of frames in the file, the sample rate, number of channels, header and sample format, number of sections and if the file is seekable or not.<br /><br />Now that we have the information from the stream, we can close it off. We do this with <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/hsndfile/latest/doc/html/Sound-File-Sndfile.html#v:hClose">hClose</a>. Now we can interrogate the Info value with a series of print statements.<br /><br />We've got a module ready to run, but we need to tell our project that it's the entry point to run. In the "sndtest.cabal" file, make sure you set your "main-is:" attribute like so.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">main-is:           Test.hs</pre><br /><h3>Build and Run</h3></div><div>We've created our project and finished our code. Let's build and run the application.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first build is going to take a bit more time as cabal-dev will need to resolve all of the dependencies that it doesn't yet have. Get this process moving with the following command.</div><div><br /></div><div><pre class="brush:shell">$ cabal-dev install</pre><br />All going well, you should be able to launch your executable and check out the results:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ dist/build/sndtest/sndtest<br />format:      Format {headerFormat = HeaderFormatWav, sampleFormat = SampleForm<br />atPcm16, endianFormat = EndianFile}<br />sample rate: 48000<br />channels:    2<br />frames:      302712<br /></pre><br />That's it for today's post. Hopefully I'll get back to this topic soon so I can write some more about audio processing.<br /><br /></div></div>
