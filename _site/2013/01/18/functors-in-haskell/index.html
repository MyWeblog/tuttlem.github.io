  <h1>Functors in Haskell</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div><a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/derived-instances-for-types-in-haskell.html">In a previous post</a>, I had lightly grazed the surface of the topic of Functors in Haskell and I thought it was time to come back and be a little more comprehensive about it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Without further ado, let's talk about Functors.</div><div><br /></div><h3>What is a Functor?</h3><div>At the code level, a Functor is any type that is an instance of the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#t:Functor">Functor</a> typeclass. At a concept level, a Functor is something that can be mapped over. As soon as anyone says something like this to me I immediately start thinking of any enumerated type (array, list, vector, etc) and this is right.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>A&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#t:Functor">Functor</a>&nbsp;only needs to implement 1 function, <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#v:fmap">fmap</a>. How this looks in Haskell is as follows.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4564195.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div>Reading this gets to be a mouthful, but bear with me. This definition says: "for my first parameter, I want a function that takes an <b><i>a</i></b> type and returns a <b><i>b</i></b>; for my second parameter, I want an <b><i>a</i></b> value wrapped by this functor and I will return you a <b><i>b</i></b> value wrapped by this functor".<br /><br />I've tried to place emphasis on a's and b's in that previous sentence, otherwise it reads like rather difficult english.<br /><br />Applying this knowledge to a living-breathing example, I'll show you the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#t:Maybe">Maybe</a> type.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4564268.js"></script></div><div>Looking at this we can see that when a "Just" value comes through, it's the value (wrapped in the Just) that has the function applied to it. When nothing comes through, we don't care for the function - we know that the return is going to be Nothing. The important thing to note here is that it's the value (wrapped in the Just) that's being operated on.<br /><br />Seeing this in action always helps an explanation.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">ghci&gt; fmap (replicate 3) (Just 4)<br />Just [4, 4, 4]</pre><br />The way that I read this is: "A function" <b>(fmap)</b>&nbsp;"that takes a function" <b>(replicate 3)</b>&nbsp;"and a functor value" <b>(Just 4)</b>&nbsp;"that then maps that function" <b>(replicate 3)</b>&nbsp;"over the inner value" <b>(4)</b>&nbsp;"which gets wrapped up in the functor" <b>(Just)</b>.<br /><br />This is the best way that I could think of to structure this sentence. It makes sense to me, I hope it helps you also. Again, the important thing to remember is that it's the inner-value that's getting processed which is why we ended up with <i>Just [4, 4, 4]</i>&nbsp;rather than <i>[Just 4, Just 4, Just 4]</i>.<br /><br />Finally, when you're implementing functors of your own there are laws that must be met.<br /><br /><b>Law #1</b>: Mapping the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#v:id">id</a>&nbsp;function over any functor value should produce the functor value that we supplied. Meaning:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">fmap id = id</pre><br /><b>Law #2</b>: Mapping two composed functions over a functor value should be the same as functionally composing those two functions. Meaning:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">fmap (f . g) = fmap f . fmap g</pre><br />This second law makes sense once you think about performing fmap over a function, as it's just the same as function composition.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">fmap (*15) (-2) == (*15) . (-2)</pre><br />This post should arm you sufficiently to start inflicting your own Functors on the world.</div></div>
