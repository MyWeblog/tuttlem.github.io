    <h1>Monoids and Associativity</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3>Associativity is a property of a function which has an output equivalent&nbsp;no matter what order the function is applied. Addition and product are examples of mathematical functions that are associative as opposed to subtraction and division which are not.<br /><br />Today's post will focus on associative functions and their definitions through Monoids in Haskell.<br /><br /><h3>Associative functions</h3>In the introduction to this post, I spoke about associative functions and gave a few examples. Here are those examples again, but demonstrated mathematically.<br /><br /><pre>(5 * 7) * 9 == 5 * (7 * 9)<br />(5 + 7) + 9 == 5 + (7 + 9)<br />(5 - 7) - 9 != 5 - (7 - 9)<br />(5 / 7) / 9 != 5 / (7 / 9)<br /></pre><br />These examples are pretty straight forward in their reading. You can see clearly that the product and addition operators are associative, subtraction and division not.<br /><br />String concatenation (or array concatenation) is also associative such that:<br /><br /><pre>"Hello " ++ ("World" ++ "!") == ("Hello " ++ "World") ++ "!"</pre><br />These proofs are pretty straight forward. I think that you should have the idea of what associative functions are by now.<br /><br /><h3>Monoids</h3><div>Monoids are Haskell's way of decorating a type that is functionally associative. The definition of a Monoid is as follows.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4627949.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>You can find more information specifically about the type up on the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Monoid.html">Haskell Wiki</a>. From the definition above, we can see that there are 3 functions to be defined.<br /><br /><h3>mempty</h3></div><div>mempty is the identity value for the monoid. It acts more like a constant rather than a function.</div><div><br /></div><h3>mappend</h3><div>mappend is the binary function that can be used between two of these typed Monoids.</div><div><br /></div><h3>mconcat</h3><div>mconcat folds the mappend function between the elements of an array of Monoids.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Monoid Laws</h3><div>Above, I have gone through the basic principals of associative functions which by-and-large cover off on the laws that a Monoid must abide by. There are some explicit ways of writing this concept, there are as follows.</div><div><ul><li><pre>mempty `mappend` x = x</pre></li><li><pre>x `mappend` mempty = x</pre></li><li><pre>(x `mappend` y) `mappend` z = x `mappend` (y `mappend` z)</pre></li></ul></div><div><br /></div><div>That's Monoids for you. Take a look as some example implementations on the Wiki and around the web.</div></div>

    <h1>Applying Applicative</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>In a <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/applicative-functors-in-haskell.html">previous post</a>, I had pretty much got the textbook definition down for an Applicative Functor and shown some of its pre-existing uses. Today's post, I want to walk through some code that I've written that implements Applicative.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Put it in context!</h3><div>Right on! It's all about context. When making instances of the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#t:Functor">Functor</a> typeclass, it's all about defining <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#v:fmap">fmap</a> appropriately to "operate" on the data that sits in a context.</div><div><br /></div><div>What's a context then? The books and articles that I've read use pre-existing types as examples. A list for instance is a context, <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#t:Either">Either</a> is a context, <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#t:Maybe">Maybe</a> is a context. All of these things wrap data. So, let's make our own context to put something in.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4633650.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div>There's our context, "CustomContext". It just wraps around something .. anything. We can apply a functor instance to this with the following.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4633664.js"></script></div><div><br /><a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Prelude.html#v:fmap">fmap</a>&nbsp;allows a function to get inside the context and operate on the inner data - alright, I've said this already. Proof that all of this is working is as follows.<br /><br /><pre>λ&gt; let x = CustomContext 10<br />λ&gt; x                       <br />CustomContext 10           <br />λ&gt; fmap (+5) x             <br />CustomContext 15           <br /></pre><br />We wrapped 10 in a context. We applied the function (+5) to the value inside our context. We got back a 15 wrapped in a context.</div><div><br /></div><div>Moving into Applicative territory now, it's not only the value that we operate on that has the context this time - it's also the function that we apply. We use the "pure" function to lift a value inside a context and we use "&lt;*&gt;" to apply a function to a value (both being inside their respective contexts).<br /><br />Here's how we'll define Applicative for our type.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4633738.js"></script> <br />The implementation of "pure" is straight forward, we're just going to pop the value in a "CustomContext" context. The sequential application function "&lt;*&gt;" is implemented very much how fmap was implemented, in fact it's the same. The difference comes in with how the parameters are supplied. We're taking the function out of the context, we take the value out of the context - we apply the function and wrap the result in the context.<br /><br />Here it is in action.<br /><br /><pre>λ&gt; CustomContext (+5) &lt;*&gt; CustomContext 10<br />CustomContext 15                          <br /><br /></pre>Also, with the use of "pure" lifting our values or functions into the context.<br /><br /><pre>λ&gt; pure (+5) &lt;*&gt; CustomContext 10<br />CustomContext 15                 <br />λ&gt; CustomContext (+5) &lt;*&gt; pure 10<br />CustomContext 15                 <br /></pre><br />Excellent. We've done it.<br /><br /><h3>Conclusion</h3></div><div>This may not be the most feature-rich example, but it should give you good insight into the implementation and workings of Applicative.</div><div>&nbsp;</div></div>

    <h1>type, newtype & data</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>This post is just a small write up on the differences between these three keywords and their uses within Haskell.</div><div><br /></div><h3>type</h3><div>Using the "type" keyword is the same as just referring to the actual type that you've declared. In other words, "type" just lets you make a synonym for the original type.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4613925.js"></script></div><div>Using these, we'll be able to refer to a Card list as a Deck. They can be used&nbsp;interchangeably as they'll directly cast. All this really does for us, is gives a pre-existing type a more meaningful name to our code.<br /><h3>newtype</h3></div><div>Using the "newtype" keyword, we make a thin wrapper around an existing type. Something that will be treated differently at compile time, but will be directly translatable (and not subject to conversion) at runtime.&nbsp;</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4599121.js"></script></div><div><br />"newtype" only allows you one constructor and one field. It's important that its used when you're creating data entries that have these constraints on them. These attributes make "newtype" a great candidate for when you just want to add a typeclass instance to an existing type.<br /><br /><h3>data</h3></div><div>The "data" keyword allows you to build much more complex types. With the "data" keyword, you can have as many constructors and fields as you like.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4614176.js"></script></div><div>Of course, it would make more sense to use "record syntax" when defining these datatypes above.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4614325.js"></script> <h3>Wrapping up</h3></div><div><ul><li>Use "type" to give your types more meaningful names</li><li>Use "newtype" if you just want to take an existing type and add a typeclass instance to it</li><li>Use "data" if you want to create your own datatype</li></ul></div></div>

    <h1>Installing Debian Squeeze on a T400</h1>
<div class='post'>
This post is just a quick guide for myself on getting <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> Squeeze installed on my T400. This guide will assume that you have already downloaded <a href="http://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/">netinst</a> media, burnt it to CD.<br /><br />Everything out of the box works pretty well. Wifi needs a little extra attention, so .. onto the guide.<br /><h3>Before you begin</h3>You'll need these from off the web:<br /><ul><li>iwlwifi-5000-1.ucode, iwlwifi-5000-2.ucode</li><li>wireless-tools</li><li>libpcsclite</li><li>libnl</li><li>libdbus</li><li>wpa_supplicant</li></ul><br /><b>*Note*</b> Through the installation process, the installer will complain that you don't have some non-free firmware. Whilst you can write the requested files&nbsp;<i>iwlfifi-5000-2.ucode</i> &amp; <i>iwlwifi-5000-1.ucode</i> to a USB stick and supply it to the installer, I still wasn't able to get wifi running through the installer. I activate it later.<br /><br />Continue the installation as normal until you're at the other end.<br /><br /><h3>Get wireless running</h3>The part of the guide is roughly based on the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/WiFi">WIFI guide</a> on the Debian site as well as the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse#Command_Line">WIFI HowTo</a>.<br /><br />Once you're system is up, mount your media that has <i>wireless-tools. </i>Install this package with the following command.<br /><br /><pre># dpkg -i wireless-tools*.deb</pre><br />Also install <i>wpa_supplicant</i>&nbsp;while you're there.<br /><br /><pre># dpkg -i libpcsclite*.deb<br /># dpkg -i libnl*.deb<br /># dpkg -i libdbus*.deb<br /># dpkg -i wpa_supplicant*.deb</pre><br />Next, we'll add an entry into the /etc/network/interfaces file for our wireless interface. It should look something like the following.<br /><br /><pre>auto wlan0<br />iface wlan0 inet dhcp<br />    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf<br /></pre><br />We now need to configure wpa_supplicant in the file that we specified above. Create a new file at /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf and add the following details.<br /><br /><pre>ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant<br /><br />ap_scan=1<br /><br />network={<br />      ssid="network-name"<br />      key_mgmt=WPA-PSK<br />      psk="secret-key"<br />}</pre><br />Bring the wireless interface up.<br /><br /><pre># ifup wlan0</pre><br />You should have an IP address now.<br /><br /><h3>Setting up software sources</h3><div>First things first. We need to change our sources list for apt. Change /etc/apt/sources.list to look like the following</div><div><br /><pre>deb http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/debian stable main contrib non-free<br />deb-src http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/debian stable main contrib non-free<br /><br />deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ squeeze-updates main contrib non-free<br />deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ squeeze-updates main contrib non-free<br /><br />deb http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main contrib non-free<br />deb-src http://security.debian.org/ squeeze/updates main contrib non-free<br /><br />deb http://www.deb-multimedia.org squeeze main non-free<br /></pre></div><div><br />Update and upgrade the system here.<br /><br /><pre># aptitude update &amp;&amp; aptitude upgrade</pre><br />Add keyring package for the <a href="http://deb-multimedia.org/">Debian Multimedia</a> repository.<br /><br /><pre># aptitude install deb-multimedia-keyring</pre><br />Re-update!<br /><br /><pre># aptitude update</pre><div><br /></div><h3>Get the basics installed</h3><div>The staple applications need to get onto the machine, so we'll install them now.</div><div><br /><pre># aptitude install zsh sudo vim git lynx</pre></div><div><br />Setup sudo by adding your normal user account to the group "sudo".<br /><br /><pre># usermod michael -aG sudo</pre><br />Now, leave the root account alone!<br /><br />Change your default shell to zsh with the following command<br /><br /><pre>$ chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh michael</pre><br />With git installed, you'll be able to clone your dotfiles repository and take most of the configuration headaches away pretty quickly.<br /><br /><h3>X (xfce)</h3><div>Install X server, xfce, gdm and associated utilities with the following.</div><div><br /><pre>$ sudo aptitude install xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies gdm</pre></div><div><br />Install a "sane" browser.<br /><br /><div><pre style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">$ sudo aptitude install chromium-browser</pre></div><div></div></div><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3>Development Environment</h3><div>Install the standard build tools.

    <h1>Applicative Functors in Haskell</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>As a follow up to my <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/functors-in-haskell.html">previous post</a>&nbsp;on Functors, it's a natural progression for me to do a post on the more advanced version, the Applicative Functor. In a normal functor, you'll map a function over a functor and applicative functor is a reverse view of this where it'll allow you to map many functor values over a single function.</div><div><br /></div><h3>What is an Applicative Functor?</h3><div>At the code level, an Applicative Functor is any type that is in instance of the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#t:Applicative">Applicative</a>&nbsp;typeclass. At a concept level, the Applicative Functor has not only the values in "a context" but also the function that we'll apply is in a context. This differs from just a normal Functor (<a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/functors-in-haskell.html">read more here</a>) where it's only the value that's wrapped in a context.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>An <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#t:Applicative">Applicative Functor</a>&nbsp;has 2 functions that require implementation. <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:pure">pure</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>. This typeclass and functions are defined as follows.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4589744.js"></script></div><div><br />The definition for&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:pure">pure</a>&nbsp;on Hoogle suggests that it will<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Lift a value</i></blockquote>"Lifting" is very well described in articles all over the web. Here's the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Lifting">Haskell Wiki's article</a>&nbsp;on Lifting.&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:pure">pure</a>&nbsp;takes in a value and returns an applicative value around that value. It's actually quite a simple definition when you read it.<br /><br />The other function defined here is&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>. &nbsp;The definition for&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>&nbsp;on Hoolgle suggests that it will perform<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Sequential application</i></blockquote>The definition of sequential application here can be expanded such that&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>&nbsp;takes a function <b>(a -&gt; b)&nbsp;</b>wrapped up in a functor&nbsp;<b>f</b> and another functor value <b>f a</b>. It'll extract the function from the first parameter <b>(a -&gt; b)</b>, map it over the functor value <b>f a</b>&nbsp;to produce a result <b>f b</b>.<br /><br />The concept is very similar to what we've seen before in mapping scenarios, it's just that we "map" with different "things". Today we're mapping with functor values over a function.<br /><br /><h3>Pure</h3>Here's some examples of&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:pure">pure</a>&nbsp;in action. You'll see that when we're casting to a type, we receive the appropriate value back<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">&gt; pure "Hey" :: Maybe String<br />Just "Hey"<br /><br />&gt; pure "Should be in a List" :: [String]<br />["Should be in a List"]<br /></pre><br />You can see here that the value is "lifted" by&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:pure">pure</a>&nbsp;into the container (in this case either a Maybe or a List).<br /><br /><h3>&lt;*&gt;</h3>For the next set of examples, I'll show you some usages of &nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>. You'll need to keep in the front of your mind that all functions on the left hand side are applied to all values on the right hand side, so we end up with a&nbsp;Cartesian&nbsp;effect.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">&gt; [sin, cos, tan] &lt;*&gt; [pi, pi, pi]<br />[1.2246467991473532e-16,1.2246467991473532e-16,1.2246467991473532e-16,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.2246467991473532e-16,-1.2246467991473532e-16,-1.2246467991473532e-16]<br /></pre><br />The&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:-60--42--62-">&lt;*&gt;</a>&nbsp;function is left associable, so when you start chaining calls together it's the leftmost that is evaluated first.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">&gt; [(+),(*)] &lt;*&gt; [1,2] &lt;*&gt; [3,4]<br />[4,5,5,6,3,4,6,8]<br /><br />(which is really)<br />[1+3,1+4,2+3,2+4,1*3,1*4,2*3,2*4]</pre><div><br /><h3>Applicative Style</h3>You can see how using this "applicative style" in code can often be swapped 1-for-1 with list comprehensions as you achieve the same permuted or&nbsp;Cartesian&nbsp;effect. Take this for example.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">&gt; [salutation ++ name | salutation &lt;- ["Hello ", "Goodbye ", "Yo! "], name &lt;- ["John", "Mary", "Anne"]]<br />["Hello John","Hello Mary","Hello Anne","Goodbye John","Goodbye Mary","Goodbye Anne","Yo! John","Yo! Mary","Yo! Anne"]<br /><br />&gt; (++) &lt;$&gt; ["Hello ", "GoodBye ", "Yo! "] &lt;*&gt; ["John", "Mary", "Anne"]<br />["Hello John","Hello Mary","Hello Anne","Goodbye John","Goodbye Mary","Goodbye Anne","Yo! John","Yo! Mary","Yo! Anne"]<br /></pre><br />You can see that when dealing with lists, the following is true:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">pure f &lt;*&gt; xs == fmap f xs</pre><br />In this context, "pure f" is putting f into a list. "[f] &lt;*&gt; xs" just applies each function in the left list to the right.<br /><br />Another implementation of the Applicative Functor that doesn't follow the same notion of a List is its use with IO. The idea of the applicative functor still holds, but when dealing with IO its the actions that are operated on. This can be thought of in the same way as sequencing and mapping in one.<br /><br /><h3>ZipList</h3>Another type that is an instance of&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#t:Applicative">Applicative</a>&nbsp;is the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:ZipList">ZipList</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:ZipList">ZipList</a>&nbsp;type is defined as follows.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4591634.js"></script> <br />When we use applicative style on a normal list, we end up with a Cartesian product of the two lists involved. A&nbsp;<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/latest/doc/html/Control-Applicative.html#v:ZipList">ZipList</a>&nbsp;differs here by operating on indicies in either list that are the same. Index [0] on the left gets applied to Index [0] on the right. Index [1] on the left gets applied to Index [1] on the right, and so on.<br /><br /><h3>Applicative Functor Laws</h3><div>Finally, there are a few laws that applicative functors must abide by, they are as follows.</div><div><div><ul><li><pre>pure id &lt;*&gt; v = v</pre></li><li><pre>pure (.) &lt;*&gt; u &lt;*&gt; v &lt;*&gt; w = u &lt;*&gt; (v &lt;*&gt; w)</pre></li><li><pre>pure f &lt;*&gt; pure x = pure (f x)</pre></li><li><pre>u &lt;*&gt; pure y = pure ($ y) &lt;*&gt; u</pre></li></ul></div></div><br /><h3>Applying applicative functors for yourself</h3><div>This has been a very difficult topic that I've burnt some time on as late. There are plenty of examples of how this knowledge has been applied for a List or Maybe, but I've struggled to apply this to a type of my own. So far though, I've come across <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Applicative_Functors">this article on Applicative Functors</a> on the Hakell Wiki and most notably this sentence:</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">Anytime you feel the need to define different higher order functions to accommodate for function-arguments with a different number of arguments, think about how defining a proper instance of Applicative can make your life easier.</blockquote>That to me makes sense. So, if you have a function that operates on a particular type and you'd like to apply that function to "n" arguments - you'd normally create an fmap clone that would cater for that many arguments. Using an applicative functor, the re-creation of the fmap instance goes away as your higher-order function can expect any number of arguments.<br /><br />Because of this, the following is true.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4601255.js"></script> That's it for today's post. I hope to update this post with some more examples and information as I discover it!</div></div></div>
