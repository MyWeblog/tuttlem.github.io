<h3>Introduction</h3>Going back to basics in this post so that I can document the methods for compilation of <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a> code. These <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a> posts will get gradually more complex but for the time being, I'm going to bore you to tears with yet another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program">"Hello, World"</a> example.<br /><br /><h3>The Code</h3>No real surprises here. We define the module, the main function and call a print-type function.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4372901.js"></script> <br /><br />Excellent. Now to compile this guy in one hit, issue the following command at the shell.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4372912.js"></script> <br />Breaking this command down, you can see that:<br /><ul><li>"ghc" is the compiler that we're using</li><li>"--make" which automatically figures out dependencies and is generally easier to use (according to the man page) than make itself</li><li>"-O2" sets the optimisation level to level 2. It's the highest level. You can read more about these levels <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7269">here</a>.</li></ul>From there it's just specifying the inputs and outputs.<br /><br />More Haskell to follow. </div>
