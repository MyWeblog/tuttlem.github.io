Initialization of variables types has received a face lift with the new version of the C++ standard. Previously trying to initialize a populated list was impossible and you were left writing helper functions to transform array values into other container types, or worse you'd end up with code that looked like this.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4551170.js"></script> C++11 includes a feature called "Uniform Initialization" which aims to solve this problem. The above code now turns into this.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4551177.js"></script> Much better. This isn't where the&nbsp;convenience&nbsp;ends though. Take the following example. Because the "person" class defines a constructor taking in first_name, last_name and age we are able to use uniform initialization to setup these variables.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4551245.js"></script> <br /><br />The same syntax works with any of the enumerated containers. Using the person class from above, we can make a map of employee records by doing the following.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4551296.js"></script> <br />You can see how this syntax makes the initialization process a much more pleasant experience in C++ now. That's all for this one.</div>
