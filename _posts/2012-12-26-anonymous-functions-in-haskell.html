<h3>Introduction</h3>It's no doubt that when you're first entering the wild world of Haskell, that it's syntax is a little alien to look at, at first glance.<br /><br />Once of the major building blocks or keys to unlocking power in Haskell are anonymous functions. The idea of higher-order functions in languages these days is becoming more of a standard rather than a feature and Haskell is no exception.<br /><br />There's plenty around on the web to read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">anonymous functions</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher-order functions</a>&nbsp;and of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a>.<br /><br /><h3>An example</h3><div>A fairly unintuitive example, but shows how you can assign an anonymous function to a handleable variable is shown:</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4377608.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div>Breaking this down, the key part is "(\x -&gt; x)". Immediately, you can see that anonymous functions take the form of (\param1 .. paramn -&gt; body).<br /><br />The real power here is unlocked when you use an anonymous function in conjunction with other functions. The best example I think is the use of the <a href="http://zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputprelude/map_f.html">map</a> function. The <a href="http://zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputprelude/map_f.html">map</a> function is defined as follows:</div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4377628.js"></script> This definition says, give me a function "f" and I'll take all of the "a"'s and turn them into "b"'s. Obviously, the anonymous function comes in for the "f" component. For simplicity, a can be an array of integers.<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4377636.js"></script><br />So the above example maps the function (x*x) across an array from 1 to 100. Easy!<br /><br />There are many other functions that can be applied in this way. Most common are <a href="http://zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputprelude/filter_f.html">filter</a>, <a href="http://zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputprelude/foldl_f.html">foldl</a> and <a href="http://zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputprelude/foldr_f.html">foldr</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="http://zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputprelude/filter_f.html">filter</a>&nbsp;function will apply a test to each item in the list and hand you back the items meeting the requirements of the test.<br /><br />Want only the odd items from a list?<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4377659.js"></script> <br />So, this introduces another function, <a href="http://zvon.org/other/haskell/Outputprelude/odd_f.html">odd</a>, which just returns true if the input is odd.<br /><br />This post could go on, but i'll stop now. The whole anonymous function idea has been explained, it's just its implementation is infinite!</div>
