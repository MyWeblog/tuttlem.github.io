Here's a quick little ruby snippet to get you sending email through your gmail account. I had to implement this recently, so I thought I'd make note of it here.<br /><br />You will need the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/tlsmail">tlsmail</a> gem install to make this happen.<br /><br />Here's the code.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4466102.js"></script> <br />That is what it's all about!</div>
