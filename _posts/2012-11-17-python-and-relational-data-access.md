If there's one job that I'm never keen on getting done, it's the mind-numbing task of wiring up data access into my application. I'm a big fan of purely abstracted data objects just so the underlying data implementation can really be anything (within reason).

With all of the <strong>Flask</strong> development that I'm doing at the moment, it was hard to go past <strong>SQLAlchemy</strong>. Quite an old-school library to all the python-heads, but quite the lifesaver to me.
