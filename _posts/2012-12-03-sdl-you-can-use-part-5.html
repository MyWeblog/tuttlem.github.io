<h3>Introduction</h3><div>What good is a game if you can't influence any of the objects? I mean, people go into battle these days armed with a keyboard, mouse and/or joystick to engage in wars never before seen.</div><div><br /></div><div>In this tutorial, I'll show you how to enable your users with such weapons of mass control (see what I did there?) ... <i>lame</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><h3>Interesting events</h3><div>It's all in the event loop. When the application receives input from a device, it'll let you know through the evening system.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's some code - not much in the way of explanations. It's a pretty simple construct.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4194490.js?file=gistfile1.c"></script></div><div><br /><br /><br />So, it's all pretty simple to respond to events. Mouse, Keyboard and Joystick motion all make up parts of the eventing system. Check out <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/docs/html/sdlevent.html">SDL_Event</a>&nbsp;for further information. It includes everything you need.<br /><br />Only a quick one!</div></div>
