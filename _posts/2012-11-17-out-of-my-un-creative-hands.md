It's no secret. I suck at style.

I don't like it, it doesn't like me.

Problem is, we need to work in harmony (somehow) as in order to host web-based projects, I need some sort of design to host the application within.

Enter: Twitter Bootstrap (<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</a>) 

The plugins, designs and documentation allow me to assemble websites without much more though.

I can go back to being an engineer!
