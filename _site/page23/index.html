    <h1>Bundler for Ruby</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>A really easy way to take the headache out of keeping your gems at the right version (especially when source controlling your projects) is to use a package manager. Today's post is about <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a>&nbsp;which helps maintain your environment for Ruby development.</div><div><br /><h3>Let's go!</h3></div><div>Install bundler.</div><div><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ gem install bundler</pre></div><div><br /></div><div>You're now installed and ready to start bundling. The first job that you need to do is to write a metafile containing all of the gems that your application requires and where bundler should fetch those gems from. This metafile is called your "Gemfile".<br /><br />A Gemfile will take the following format.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:ruby">source "http://rubygems.org"<br />gem "nokogiri"              <br />gem "premailer"             <br />gem "tlsmail"</pre><br />The "source" tells bundler what site to download the gems from. The most common ones that I've seen are as follows. <br /><br /><pre class="brush:ruby">source :rubygems<br />source "http://rubygems.org"<br /><br />source :rubyforge<br />source "http://gems.rubyforge.org"<br /><br />source :gemcutter<br />source "http://gemcutter.org"</pre><br />You can see each of the sources here with a symbolic shortcut that you can use also.<br /><br />The "gem" tells bundler that you have a dependency. You can also constrain the version of your dependencies on these lines by using version information after the gem.<br /><br />Now that you've created your Gemfile, you can install all of the gems and their dependencies simple by changing directories to where your Gemfile resides and typing the following at the prompt.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ bundle install</pre><br />Now you have all of your dependencies installed for your application. Doing this will generate a Gemfile.lock file in your directory also. Make sure that you source control both your Gemfile and Gemfile.lock.<br /><br />That's it.<br /><br /></div></div>

        Loading an image with SDL_Image for OpenGL

    <h1>Loading an image with SDL_Image for OpenGL</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>One of those "routine tasks" that comes up each time I go to write a game in C/C++ is loading an image using SDL and getting it in context of OpenGL. Today I'll post the code that I use to get the job done. It's pretty common code and straight forward so it won't need much explanation.</div><div><br /></div><h3>The Code</h3><div>First up, we have some variables that I like to hang on to. Your choice weather you hold onto the the format and number of colours, but you'll certainly want to keep track of the texture variable.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4460207.js"></script></div><div><br />Next up is the crux of the work. The file/IO and transformation is really done by the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/">SDL_Image</a> library. So helpful, so easy! Keep in mind that you'll need to link against it at compile time (-lSDL_Image).<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4460230.js"></script> The code does assume that you're giving this program a texture with dimensions on the power-of-2 as OpenGL expects. If you don't - it's at your own peril. Like I said, there's nothing really out of the ordinary here. Load the file, find out some format parameters, build the OpenGL texture.<br /><br />At this point we have a texture that we can call <a href="http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glBindTexture.xml">glBindTexture</a> on, ready to go. You will want to make sure that TEXTURE_2D is enabled of course during your program's initialisation.<br /><br />Tearing down is really quite simple (and naturally OpenGL) also.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4460259.js"></script> Job's done!<br /><br />If you are interested, I've encapsulated a fair bit of this in an SDL helper library that I'm building at the moment called sdlper. You can grab it from my GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/tuttlem/libsdlper/">here</a>.</div></div>

        Either type in Haskell

    <h1>Either type in Haskell</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>Doing some further work in the world of Haskell and have come across the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Either.html">Either</a> type from the base library on a few occasions. Today I'll post about how to work with this type as you'll come across it a bit and it is quite handy.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Background</h3><div>Just as its english counterpart describes,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Either.html">Either</a>&nbsp;can represent one value or another. Scenarios where this might be the return value from a function where you may get the successful result value or you might get an error value.</div><div><br /></div><div>The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Either.html">Either</a>&nbsp;data type is defined as follows.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4459889.js"></script></div><div><br />You construct an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Either.html">Either</a>&nbsp;by calling either the Left or Right constructor.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/Data-Either.html">Either</a>&nbsp;is just a wrapper around a value that can be either one or the other.<br /><br /><h3>Working with it</h3></div><div>In GHCI I have created two instances of Either. "lefty" is constructed using Left, "righty" with Right.</div><div><br /><pre>&gt; let lefty = Left 10<br />&gt; let righty = Right "John"<br /></pre><pre>&gt; :t lefty<br />lefty :: Either Integer b<br /></pre><pre>&gt; :t righty<br />righty :: Either a [Char]<br /></pre></div><div><br />That all seems pretty straight forward. Calling Left or Right gives us back a value of an incomplete type. Haskell only really knows how to fill the types out that we've actually used.<br /><br />Having a look at the values that we've created, we're reminded that they are either Left or Right values as such.<br /><br /><pre>&gt; lefty<br />Left 10<br /></pre><pre>&gt; righty<br />Right "John"<br /></pre><br />Convenient, but if we're going to have a chance of using these values for anything real, we'll need to extract or unbox the value from the Either construct. The Either type has two functions which will take the boxed values into array called "lefts" and "rights". This makes sense. Take a look at how these functions interact with lefty and righty.<br /><br /><pre>&gt; lefts [lefty]<br />[10]<br />&gt; rights [lefty]<br />[]<br /></pre><pre>&gt; lefts [righty]<br />[]<br />&gt; rights [righty]<br />["John"]<br /></pre><br />They've now been taken out of the Either construct and are values ready to be processed sitting in a list.<br /><br />In the next example, we use pattern matching to detect if we're trying to divide by zero. Even though my preference is to always say that it's infinity, computers just like to complain about it.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4459950.js"></script> <br />The type that's used here "Either String Float" says that we're either going to receive a String or a Float in this value. You can see the case for zero division offering a String on the Left, otherwise we supply the quotient on the Right.<br /><br />There ya have it!</div></div>

One day, when I get a chance I will get through this entire article and actually give it a crack, but, until they invent the 48 hour day I'm stuck with just making a bookmark post.<br /><br />I've scratched the surface of this article and it's comprehensive. Really very interesting if it's your sort of thing.<br /><br /><a href="http://jonathan2251.github.com/lbd/index.html">http://jonathan2251.github.com/lbd/index.html</a></div>

    <h1>Recursive Data Structures in Haskell</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>As I've been following along in <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a>, I've been coming across some really interesting material around the type system. In today's post, I want to walk through the Tree data type that they define in this book for the section on recursive data structures.</div><div><br /></div><h3>What it is?</h3><div>A recursive data structure is a type that has itself as a type amongst its fields. Pretty wild idea, but really useful for situations of Child-&gt;Parent, Tree-&gt;Leaf, etc. In today's example we're going to be using the Tree structure which looks like this.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4447497.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>This data type reads as, a "Tree" can either be an EmptyTree or it can have two nodes (that are also trees). You can start to see that this would be a best-fit as a binary search tree. Using an instance of Functor, we can give the the Tree data type&nbsp;recursively&nbsp;iterative&nbsp;properties through fmap.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4447642.js"></script> <br /><h3>Using the type</h3></div><div>Getting data into the tree is done cleverly (or so I think) with some basic pattern matching. I think it's done cleverly because it reads so well/humanly (perhaps I'm easily pleased).<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4447669.js"></script> <br />Inserting an EmptyTree node will result in a node with an EmptyTree either side.&nbsp;Inserting data for key that exists will overwrite the existing data. Inserting a lesser key (lesser according to Ord) will put the node on the left, greater onto the right.<br /><br />Actually building a tree can be as simple as the following.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4447713.js"></script> <br />This results in a tree that looks like this.<br /><br /><pre>*Main&gt; fmap (*1) (foldr treeInsert EmptyTree [5,7,3])<br />Node 3 EmptyTree (Node 7 (Node 5 EmptyTree EmptyTree) EmptyTree)</pre><br />3 is at the trunk with no left-hand-side. 3's right hand side has a 7 with 5 for its left hand side and no right hand sides (for 5 or 7). Reading the dump out from ghci is going to be better for your understanding than trying to read my English describing the tree's structure.<br /><br />The important part that I wanted to illustrate really was the use of fmap here. We map the function (*1) so that none of the values in our source array change. We apply "treeInsert" in a fold-right starting with EmptyTree across the source array [5,7,3].<br /><br />If you ask me, that's pretty cool.<br /><br /></div></div>
