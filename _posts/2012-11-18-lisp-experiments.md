I've always been interested in the mesmerising effect of browsing LISP style code. I wanted to make a blog post just to remember to take a look at it from time to time.

Installation in a debian-based world is as simple as

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install clisp
{% endhighlight %}

You'll also be able to dress your code up inside of vim with [Rainbow Parentheses](https://github.com/kien/rainbow_parentheses.vim)

Just remember to take a look!
