<h3>Introduction</h3><div>In my <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/pygame-part-1-window.html">previous post</a>&nbsp;in this article series, we created a window and repeatedly painted black to the screen. A major flaw had crept into this application already. We weren't considering the operating system what so ever and therefore this made for a very unresponsive application.</div><div><br /></div><div>Events help our pygame applications respond to "things" that happen. This could be a key being pressed, the mouse being moved or simply that a quit message was sent to the application.</div><div><br /></div><div>Today's post will focus on processing events in our pygame application.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Listening for Events</h3><div>The <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html">documentation</a> on the event module in pygame is quite extensive. It covers everything off in the API and is the perfect reference for when you're stuck. We're interested in <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.poll">pygame.event.poll</a> for our purposes. We'll use this function to continuously check for events of interest that have occurred.</div><div><br /></div><div>The only change from our initial code is that our game is controlled by a boolean as to weather it is still running or not. That variable then gets flipped if a quit message is detected by the framework.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's the code.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/4976682.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>This is a pretty simple example and don't let it fool you. The eventing system will cover all of your needs as far as responding to in-game actions.<br /><br />Running this code, the application will now respond to the operating system and will terminate gracefully when it receives a quit message.<br /><br />Simple.</div></div>
