Only a short post. The <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/ThinkWiki">ThinkWiki</a> has a great little <a href="http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/How_to_disable_the_pc_speaker_(beep!)">write-up</a>&nbsp;on disabling the pc speaker device under Debian linux. I thought I'd just shortcut the details in this post.<br /><br />Remove the pc speaker module<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell;">sudo modprobe -r pcspkr snd_pcsp</pre><br />Remove the pc speaker permanently<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell;"># the following lines need to be added to<br /># the /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf<br /><br /># make sure you find out which device you actually have<br />blacklist pcspkr<br />blacklist snd_pcsp<br /></pre><br />Anyway, these are just the details to disable the device. The ThinkWiki article has some other ideas also on how to make the bell tone tolerable. Not for me though. I can't stand it.<br /><br /><br /></div>
