I think it's important to follow up my previous post on <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/anonymous-functions-in-haskell.html">anonymous functions</a>&nbsp;with a post on currying. One of the more difficult concepts to think about (only because Haskell does a great job of separating you from this) is that every function only has 1 argument.<br /><br />Take this basic greeting example which expects the name of someone who is doing the greeting and the name of someone who is being greeted:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4377706.js"></script> <br />This is a pretty trivial example. Give it two names and the computer will appear to play nice between these two people:<br /><br /><pre>*Main&gt; sayHello "John" "Peter"<br />"Peter says Hello to John"</pre><br />We like John so much, that we're going to make a new function using this existing one.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4377714.js"></script> <br />So now, we can get anyone to play nice with John:<br /><br /><pre>*Main&gt; sayHelloToJohn "Peter"<br />"Peter says Hello to John"<br />*Main&gt; sayHelloToJohn "Joe"<br />"Joe says Hello to John"<br />*Main&gt; sayHelloToJohn "Jane"<br />"Jane says Hello to John"</pre><br />Great! We've just made a partially applied function. When you don't specify enough parameters to a function, you're actually returned a function (or, partially applied function) that you can continue to use.&nbsp;Breaking down how this works, when Jane is saying hello to John she is actually doing so by doing this:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4377723.js"></script> This should at least explain my outlandish claims above of functions only having one argument, anyway.<br /><br />You've just witnessed function currying in motion.<br /><br />These principles are also directly applicable on infix functions as well, they just need a little extra help to be told so. Take this for example:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4385044.js"></script> <br />Ignoring the function definition, you can see that all you need to do for infix functions is to&nbsp;surround then with parenthesis. You need to supply the value that makes it a partial application of course!<br /><br /><br /></div>
