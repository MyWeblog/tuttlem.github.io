<h3>Introduction</h3><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">Simple DirectMedia Layer</a>&nbsp;is a cross-platform library aimed at providing all the fun stuff (video, audio, input, etc) so that you can build fantastic <strike>games</strike>&nbsp;<strike>demos</strike> applications.<br /><br />This is a series of tutorials that will get you up and running in a very short time.<br /><br />These tutorials do assume that you've installed SDL and your installation is working without hassle. Being that we are dealing with a cross-platform library, I'll attempt to be as platform agnostic as possible. I will be writing these tutorials from my MacBook Pro though.<br /><br />If you aren't quite at the stage where you can start coding, I'd suggest you run through some of the instructions around on the web. <a href="http://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/lesson01/index.php">Lazy Foo</a>&nbsp;has done a lot of the work here providing installation instructions for specific platforms.<br /><br />A final introductory note is that I'll be using the GNU toolchain to conduct these tutorials.<br /><br />Anyway, let's get a build environment up and running and then a window showing to screen.<br /><br /><h3>The build environment</h3><div>Making a scenario where you rebuild your application over and over quickly and painlessly increases the enjoyment of the development process, I find.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's a simple Makefile that you can use for any simple SDL project that you might have. I'll walk you through it.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4188388.js?file=gistfile1.mak"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The rules at the top, specifying switches to the compiler and linker are really doing all of the heavy lifting for the build process. Focusing on <a href="http://koshmaar.linuxpl.info/sdl_config/news.php">sdl-config</a>&nbsp;you can see that we want sdl flags for the compiler and for the linker.<br /><br />On my OSX machine, these commands give me the following output:<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell;">[michael@zoso] ~ $ sdl-config --cflags<br />-I/usr/local/include/SDL -D_GNU_SOURCE=1 -D_THREAD_SAFE<br />[michael@zoso] ~ $ sdl-config --libs<br />-L/usr/local/lib -lSDLmain -lSDL -Wl,-framework,Cocoa<br /></pre><br /><br />Fantastic. The purpose of these rules is it should make the transporting of this software between machines and platforms a much more portable experience!<br /><br />So, we're still at a false start here. I've given you a Makefile that makes mention of tute0.c, but no source code, so ...<br /><br /><h3>Show me a window for a couple of seconds</h3></div><div>It's a useless example. I really hate it, but I wanted to defer message handling until the next instalment. This one, I just want to show you initialization and termination.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4188425.js?file=tute0.c"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/docs/html/sdlinit.html">SDL_Init</a> providing all of the initialization required to be "in the framework". <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/docs/html/sdlsetvideomode.html">SDL_SetVideoMode</a> is quite self explanatory. There will be some different flags that we'll pass to that in later articles that will give us some acceleration (where available). Finally, <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/docs/html/sdlquit.html">SDL_Quit</a> takes us out of the framework, making SDL clean up anything that was left outstanding.<br /><br />A compile and a run ...<br /><br />And for a few fleeting seconds, you're an SDL programmer:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8pzGZm3W3Ac/ULtJmCtx_7I/AAAAAAAAAig/knahjFWw_HM/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-12-02+at+10.28.22+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="313" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8pzGZm3W3Ac/ULtJmCtx_7I/AAAAAAAAAig/knahjFWw_HM/s400/Screen+Shot+2012-12-02+at+10.28.22+PM.png" width="400" /></a></div><br />That's it for this one, nice and simple. We can hit messaging in the next tutorial, just so we can keep the window on screen a bit longer.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
