This is the biggest change (shift anyway) in C++'s thinking with the new standard. This preview of Rvalue references probably isn't pitched at the novice and a bit of prior knowledge is assumed. You'll want to know the differences between an <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/comphelp/v7v91/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.vacpp7a.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fclrc05lvalue.htm">Lvalue and an Rvalue</a>, you'll also want to understand how <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/lnxpcomp/v8v101/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.xlcpp8l.doc%2Flanguage%2Fref%2Fcplr382.htm">temporary objects work</a>&nbsp;but most importantly why they're evil in some scenarios.<br /><br />With all of that information under our belt, I can see that the Rvalue reference came to fruition to resolve the copy problem. Returning a temporary object from a function that you'd use in your program would cause an expensive copy operation, now this is is resolved with move semantics.<br /><br />Rather than that expensive copy operation, the value that's returned is pilfered to the calling code and the temporary object is left empty, ergo a move occurs.<br /><br />An Rvalue reference is defined in code like so.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4555645.js"></script> The double ampersand (&amp;&amp;) tells us that it's an Rvalue reference. We can give our own classes the ability to "move" a value by introducing a move constructor and operator like so.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4555709.js"></script> <br />The STL containers have all been optimised to use move syntax, so you'll pick up this copy-free functionality on the way.</div>
