A very simple effect this time around. It's snow flakes. The operating premise for the effect is very simple and goes like this:<br /><br /><ul><li>Generate 1 new snow flake at the top of the screen at every frame</li><li>A snow flake has an absolute floor of the last line in video memory</li><li>A snow flake should come to rest if it lands on top of another</li></ul><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pE0K1mfiABg/ULoEn3kZ6bI/AAAAAAAAAiQ/BVre5BA5iy0/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-12-01+at+11.10.27+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pE0K1mfiABg/ULoEn3kZ6bI/AAAAAAAAAiQ/BVre5BA5iy0/s400/Screen+Shot+2012-12-01+at+11.10.27+PM.png" width="400" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>That's it! So, immediately we need a way to get random numbers.</div><div><br /></div><div>We're using a 320x200 screen here and my dodgy routine for getting random numbers only returns us 8 bit numbers (which gets us to 255). We need to add some more width to these numbers if we expect to be able to randomize across the whole 320 column positions. Calling the random port twice and adjusting the resolution of the second number should do it for us, such that:</div><div><br /></div><div>8 bits (256) and 6 bits (64) will give us 320 - or the ability to add using 14 bits worth of numbers, which in this configuration takes us up to 320. Perfect.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's the code!</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4182207.js?file=gistfile1.asm"></script></div><div><br /><br />Excellent. We can span the breadth of our screen with random flakes. Now it's time to progress them down the screen. Here's the main frame routine to do so.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4182214.js?file=gistfile1.asm"></script> <br />The code itself above is pretty well commented, you shouldn't need me to add much more here. There are a couple too many labels in the code, but they should help to add readability.<br /><br />I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to implement different speeds, colours and maybe even some horizontal movement (wind).<br /><br />Cool stuff.</div></div>
