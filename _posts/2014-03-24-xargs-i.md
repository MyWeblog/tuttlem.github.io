This post is a just a tid-bit for the use of [xargs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xargs) in [bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)).

If you can get a list of work to do from a file or stream, you can pipe these into `xargs` to do further work. An example of this, I've taken from [here](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-bsd-xargs-construct-argument-lists-utility/). This will find all of the *.bak in or below the current directory and delete them.

{% highlight bash %}
find . -name "*.bak" -type f -print | xargs /bin/rm -f
{% endhighlight %}

Extending the usage of `xargs` to incorporate the `-i` switch, you can replace "{}" with the line of text read in the preprended command.

{% highlight bash %}
cat url_endings | xargs -i wget "http://somewhere.com"
{% endhighlight %}

In this command, it's expected that the file "url_endings" would be data that looks like this:

{% highlight text %}
/files/first
/files/second
/files/third
etc . . 
{% endhighlight %}
