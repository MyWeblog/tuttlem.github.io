<h3>Introduction</h3><div>There's plenty of shells around these days to try out and see what fits. I've forever used bash and have become quite accustomed to it in day to day usage. I've heard plenty of murmurs around the use of zsh and how all of my bash skills would translate directly but I would get some extra added benefits.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's time for me to dive in!&nbsp;This post is to take you through a migration process from bash to zsh. I expect that this post will grow over time.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Installation</h3><div>I'll assume that you're using <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">brew</a>&nbsp;in your installation of OSX just to lower the level of insanity of your life.</div><div><br /></div><div>Type the following in your shell to get zsh installed.</div><div><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ brew install zsh</pre></div><div></div><br />Next, you'll need to register it as an acceptable shell for OSX to use, so to do this add a line referencing your newly installed zsh to your /etc/shells file. Here's how mine looks, my new entry was added to the bottom.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain"># List of acceptable shells for chpass(1).<br /># Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using<br /># one of these shells.<br /><br />/bin/bash<br />/bin/csh<br />/bin/ksh<br />/bin/sh<br />/bin/tcsh<br />/bin/zsh<br />/usr/local/bin/zsh<br /></pre><br />When brew installed zsh for me, it also reported that there was some extra administration that needed to happen. It said:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">If you have administrator privileges, you must fix an Apple missconfiguration in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion by renaming /etc/zshenv to/etc/zprofile, or Zsh will have the wrong PATH when executednon-interactively by scripts. <br /><br />Alternatively, install Zsh with /etc disabled: <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;brew install --disable-etcdir zsh </blockquote>So, I just renamed /etc/zshenv to /etc/zprofile with the following command to comply.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ sudo mv /etc/zshenv /etc/zprofile</pre><br />Now you can register zsh as the default shell for OSX with the following command.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh</pre><br />Fantastic. Close your terminal and reopen a new one - you're now in zsh.<br /><br /><h3>Kickstart</h3><div>To drop yourself "right in it", head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a>&nbsp;repository and get yourself some theming happening.&nbsp;The installation instructions over there are very straight forward, and you'll go from % sign to something spectacular in no time at all.</div></div>
