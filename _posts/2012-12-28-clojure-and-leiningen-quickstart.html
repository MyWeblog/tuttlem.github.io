<h3>Introduction</h3><div><a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is the modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">LISP</a>. Clojure is an elegant, dynamic programming language that runs a-top the JVM. In today's post, I'll show you how to get started with Clojure &amp; <a href="http://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>.</div><h3><br /></h3><h3>Getting installed</h3><div>I've written this article from the perspective of a Debian user. Translating these steps into your own native environments should be as easy as re-structuring the installation steps to target your package manager of choice.</div><div><br /></div><div>Installing Clojure &amp; Leiningen was a simple as this:</div><div><pre># aptitude install clojure leiningen</pre></div><div><br /></div><div>You're done. You should now have Clojure and Leiningen at your disposal.</div><div><h3><br /></h3><h3>Initial steps</h3></div><div>You'll want to kick the tires on this puppy, so from your bash prompt fire up the REPL environment and try a few commands:</div><div><br /><pre>$ clojure<br /><br />Clojure 1.2.1<br />user=&gt; (+ 2 4)<br />6<br /><br />user=&gt; (print "Clojure is installed!")<br />Clojure is installed!nil<br /><br />user=&gt; (if (= 1 1) (print "Yes, 1 does equal 1") (print "Mathematics just stopped<br />working"))<br />Yes, 1 does equal 1nil<br /></pre></div><div><br /></div><div>Alright! Enough of this already. Let's generate a project.<br /><br /><a href="http://leiningen.org/">Leiningen</a>&nbsp;is a painless way to get started on your Clojure project. All you have to do, is issue the following commands and you've got a project ready to go:<br /><br /><pre>$ lein new projname</pre><br /></div><div>Where "projname" is the name of your project. For this test, I just called mine "myproj". If you have a look inside the directory that Leiningen has just generated for you, you'll see the following sub-directories:<br /><br /><pre>lib         - holds your programs dependencies<br />project.clj - a clojure file describing your project <br />README      - duh! <br />src         - your source files <br />test        - any tests for your application<br /></pre><br />This is a pretty neat-and-tidy layout, ready for you to start coding.<br /><br /><h3>Bulding and running and cleaning, oh my!</h3><div>Leiningen also makes it very easy to build, run and cleanup your project. Here's how. From within your project directory:</div><div><br />You can build your project by:<br /><pre>$ lein compile</pre><br />You can clean any built files by:<br /><pre>$ lein clean</pre><br />You can run your project with:<br /><pre>$ lein run</pre></div><div><br /></div>Too easy.</div></div>
