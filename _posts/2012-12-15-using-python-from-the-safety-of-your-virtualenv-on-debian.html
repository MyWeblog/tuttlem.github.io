I like having my specific development environments setup, tailored for the particular project that I'm working on. When I'm working on a python project, <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a> is my go to tool for the job. It's great.<br /><br />We're going to install this using easy_install so that these instructions should translate pretty well to any linux environment. I am doing this from my Debian workstation though.<br /><br />First up, we need to install the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/python-setuptools">python-setuptools</a> package so that we get access to easy_install.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell;">sudo apt-get install python-setuptools</pre><br />Next we install&nbsp;<a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>&nbsp;with easy_install<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell;">sudo easy_install virtualenv</pre><br />As far as the installation is considered, you're done! It's that easy.<br /><br />From here you can start to use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>&nbsp;for all of your python based projects. I'll do a quick cheat-sheet write up shortly on how to use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>&nbsp;at a glance.</div>
