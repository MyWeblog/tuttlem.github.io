<div class='post'>
After installing Debian within a few VMWare virtual machines, I keep getting a rather annoying and persistent "mpt-statusd: detected non-optimal RAID status" spamming out my unix mail box as well as /var/log/messages.<br /><br />Simplest solution that I've come across is to just . . .<br /><br /><br /><pre class="brush: shell">$ sudo apt-get remove mpt-status</pre><br /><br />Yup! That's it.</div>
