<h1>Pygame Part 5 Music</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>In the previous article in this series, we were talking about adding sound effects to our games for that extra level of immersion. Sounds effects really do add that needed atmosphere to your game, but so does music. Music provides the perfect ambient touch to that game scene or just gives you an excuse to get your "8-bit" on!</div><div><br /></div><div>In today's post, we'll load some music from disk and play it while our ball is moving around the screen.&nbsp;We'll be using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV">WAV format</a> today for our media.<br /><br /><h3>Get loaded</h3></div><div>Using our code from the last article, all we need to do is issue a call to <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html#pygame.mixer.music.load">pygame.mixer.music.load</a>&nbsp;to get the wave file off disk and into memory. Once we've done this, we can start playing the loaded music track using <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html#pygame.mixer.music.play">pygame.mixer.music.play</a>. It takes a few parameters specific to playing the track, but for our purposes we'll play the track once and that's it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's the code.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/5023016.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>So now our ball is flying around the window with Toto cranking out "Africa" in the background. Awesome :)<br /><br />Very simple code but very effective in adding atmosphere, ambience and emotion to your digital landscape.</div></div>
