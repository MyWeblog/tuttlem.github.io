<h3>Introduction</h3><div>In the <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/making-big-math-library.html">previous post</a>, we had setup a basic array data type to act as a very big number. We implemented an initialise, increment and decrement function. Today we'll extend on this library by adding some zero testing. It is of interest to us when our numbers are zero and when they aren't.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Scanning our number</h3><div>The plan of attack is to use a scan string quad-word (scasq). We're going to enumerate our array, testing each block for zero. If we make it to the end of the array, we have a zero number. If our scanning got interrupted by a non-zero number, our overall number couldn't possibly be zero.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's the code.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4660728.js"></script></div><div></div>Now that we've got this function, we can wrap it up with a print so we can visually see if a number is zero or not. This will also give you basic usage of the function above.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4660742.js"></script> <br /><br /><h3>In action</h3><div>Now that we've got a little helper function to wrap up our is-zeroness and reporting on this to the console, we're free to test it out as follows.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4660760.js"></script></div><div><br />To which we end up with a result looking like this.<br /><br /><pre>âžœ  bigmath  ./bigmath<br />The number was zeroThe number was not zero                               <br /></pre><br />As expected. Initially the number was zero, after incrementation is was not.<br /><br />There's some basic logic testing for your big number.</div></div>
