  <h1>Unit Testing with QuickCheck</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>Seems I'm forever making card games <i>in Haskell</i>, so it only seemed right that I try and make a library of routines and data types that will get me going quicker. Don't get me wrong, I intend on doing something serious with Haskell one day - I just seriously lack the chops to do so right now.</div><div><br /></div><div>As with any development process, you as a developer should write unit tests. Not only is it good practice but it also gives you a repeatable base of executions to assure you that the last change you put in won't break your masterpiece.</div><div><br /></div><div>Today I want to talk about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a> unit testing library for Haskell.</div><div><br /></div><h3>What are we testing?</h3><div>To give you an idea of the playing field we're on, I'll just post some of the simple routines that I have done so far. First up is the data types that will help us represent a single playing card.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4412543.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>A card has a suit and a value. Pretty straight forward. I could have made a type that wrapped an array of the Card type and called it "Deck", but I'm happy just handling an array of Card. Now to build a deck and to shuffle it!<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4412555.js"></script> <br />When a deck is built with "makeDeck" the cards are ordered just like they are when you open a fresh deck of cards, so we need to shuffle them in order to make this game any fun! "seedCards" assigns a random value to each card that it is passed and then "makeShuffledDeck" saves the day by ordering by this random seed to give a shuffled deck.<br /><br />That's all pretty simple still and that's where the "testable" parts stop. So, still the question: what are we testing? Well, I'm sure there are plenty of other scenarios, but for today's purposes we'll test the following:<br /><br /><ul><li>Are there 52 cards in a deck made by "makeDeck"</li><li>Are there still 52 cards in a deck after they've been processed by "makeShuffledDeck"</li><li>Is the deck made by "makeDeck" not in the same order as the deck made by "makeShuffledDeck"?</li></ul><br />Great. With these three scenarios in mind, here's how easy it is to assert these facts using QuickCheck.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4412589.js"></script> <br />As it should be, these tests read rather humanly. And after running this suite of tests we end up with the following results:<br /><br /><pre>+++ OK, passed 1 tests.<br />+++ OK, passed 100 tests.<br />+++ OK, passed 100 tests.</pre><br />Hold on! 100 tests? We only defined 3 tests though. How can this be? You'll see that for the second and third tests actually have an anonymous function passed to them. Because both of these depend on a random number generator (to shuffle the deck), I've passed in <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/random/latest/doc/html/System-Random.html#v:mkStdGen">mkStdGen</a>'s integer that it maps to a generator from the function's parameter list.<br /><br />QuickCheck grabbed hold of this and rather than just running 1 test, it went ahead and gave the anonymous function 100 random values. That's much better coverage for what is seemingly the cost of defining the test as an anonymous method.<br /><br />Immediately you can see the power of unit testing with such a simple framework and how you can be productive relatively quickly.<br /><br /></div></div>
