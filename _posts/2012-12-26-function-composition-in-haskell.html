<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition">Function composition</a> is a no-brainer concept <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Function_composition">for Haskell</a> that makes a lot of sense. It's truly aligned with its mathematical equivelant where you have two given functions:<br /><br /><pre>f(x) = x * x<br />g(x) = x + 2</pre><br />The composition part comes in when you nest these functions, so that you end up with:<br /><br /><pre>f(g(x)) = f(x + 2)<br />f(g(x)) = (x + 2) * (x + 2)<br />f(g(x)) = x^2 + 4x + 4</pre><br />Mathematically, this is cake. We just nest the second function inside the first. If we look at it with respect to Haskell we end up with this:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4380029.js"></script> <br />So, the "." operator is doing the composition here for us. Below I've got the mathematical representation on the left, Haskell on the right.<br /><br /><pre>f(g(x)) = (f . g) x</pre><br />The real power here is that you can use function composition with any two functions, just as long as the &nbsp;return type of the second function is the same as the argument taken by the first function.<br /><br />Slick.</div>
