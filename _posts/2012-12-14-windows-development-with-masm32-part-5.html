<h3>Introduction</h3><div>Welcome to the fifth instalment in the series on writing windows applications using MASM32. We've covered the basics pretty thoroughly in parts <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/windows-development-with-masm32-part-1.html">1</a>, <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/windows-development-with-masm32-part-2.html">2</a> and <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/windows-development-with-masm32-part-3.html">3</a>. We took a bit of a left turn for part <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/windows-development-with-masm32-part-4.html">4</a>&nbsp;covering double buffering which admittedly is a bit of an advanced topic.</div><div><br /></div><div>We're back on the straight and narrow now - today we're going to discuss common controls.<br />&nbsp;</div><h3>What are they?</h3><div><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb775493(v=vs.85).aspx">Window common controls</a>&nbsp;are served out of a dll called Comctl32.dll. The fill list can be found <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773169(v=vs.85).aspx">here</a>&nbsp;and there's heaps in there: toolbar, tooltip, status bar, property sheet, treeview, trackbar, the list goes on.<br />&nbsp;</div><h3>Show me!</h3><div>Today, we're just going to create a simple, humble, <strong><u>common</u></strong> status bar for our window. First up, we need to import another header and library. Nicely enough these are named comctl32.inc and comctl32.lib respectively.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4285388.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div>Next up we have a touch of initialization to get the library in gear. This is just a one-liner.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4285408.js"></script><br />So, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb775695(VS.85).aspx">InitCommonControls</a>&nbsp;just initializes the window classes involved in using common controls. Now we'll use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632619(v=vs.85).aspx">WM_CREATE</a> message in the window procedure to actually create our child controls. In our case today, it's just going to be the status window. So, we'll use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb760762(v=vs.85).aspx">CreateStatusWindow</a>.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4285572.js"></script><br /><br />We can fire our application up now and see our statusbar in all its glory at the bottom of the window. This isn't really enough though. I really need to show you how to put something in the status window. A good case here, I think is just some text. I'm sure that you will find much more useful things to do with this, but for this purposes of this post, when a user clicks in the window area with their left mouse button, I'm going to put the string "Click!" into the status bar.<br /><br />Note the use of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms644950(v=vs.85).aspx">SendMessage</a>. This is how we'll instruct all of our UI objects to do things of interest for us. Sending messages is how we all co-operate in windows land.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4285606.js"></script><br />So, that's it for a very tip-of-the-ice-berg (and it's a massive one) look at common controls.</div></div>
