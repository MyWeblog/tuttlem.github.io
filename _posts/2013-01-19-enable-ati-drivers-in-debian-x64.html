<h3>Introduction</h3>Today's post, I'll run through the procedures that I've just conducted to get AMD ATI drivers running on my T400 in Debian.<br /><br /><h3>Doing easily with "non-free"</h3>To save myself a few manual installation steps, I ended up just enabling non-free on my repositories. In order to do this, open up /etc/apt/sources.list and for your main repository line (which will look something similar to this)<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib</pre><br />Just add "non-free" into repositories that you need, like so.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free</pre><br />After performing any changes to your sources list, it's always an idea to update your package lists with the following command.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ sudo aptitude update</pre><br /><h3>Installing the driver</h3>After you've enabled "non-free" on your repository, installation is a piece of cake. Remove the existing radeon driver from your system like so.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ sudo apt-get remove --purge xserver-xorg-video-radeon</pre><br />Install the new drivers and associated utilities.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ sudo apt-get install fglrx-driver fglrx-control fglrx-glx fglrx-atieventsd fglrx-modules-dkms</pre><br />Be sure to install 32-bit support for your 32-bit applications as well.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:shell">$ sudo apt-get install fglrx-glx-ia32</pre><br /><h3>Finishing up</h3>A minor amount of housekeeping is required to enable the driver for use. First up, the module that we've just installed needs to be enabled at boot. To do this, I've added "fglrx" to my /etc/modules file. The /etc/modules file on my Debian laptop reads like this.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain"># /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.<br />#<br /># This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded<br /># at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.<br /># Parameters can be specified after the module name.<br /><br />fglrx<br />firewire-sbp2<br />loop<br /></pre><br />Finally, X needs to be to told that you want to use the fglrx driver. This is pretty simple, by setting your "Driver" to "fglrx" in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf. For reference, here is my config.<br /><br /><pre class="brush:plain">Section "ServerLayout"<br /> Identifier     "aticonfig Layout"<br /> Screen      0  "aticonfig-Screen[0]-0" 0 0<br />EndSection<br /><br />Section "Module"<br />EndSection<br /><br />Section "Monitor"<br /> Identifier   "aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0"<br /> Option     "VendorName" "ATI Proprietary Driver"<br /> Option     "ModelName" "Generic Autodetecting Monitor"<br /> Option     "DPMS" "true"<br />EndSection<br /><br />Section "Device"<br /> Identifier  "aticonfig-Device[0]-0"<br /> Driver      "fglrx"<br /> BusID       "PCI:1:0:0"<br />EndSection<br /><br />Section "Screen"<br /> Identifier "aticonfig-Screen[0]-0"<br /> Device     "aticonfig-Device[0]-0"<br /> Monitor    "aticonfig-Monitor[0]-0"<br /> DefaultDepth     24<br /> SubSection "Display"<br />  Viewport   0 0<br />  Depth     24<br /> EndSubSection<br />EndSection<br /></pre><br />You should have no problems wowing all your friends with crazy window composition now! </div>
