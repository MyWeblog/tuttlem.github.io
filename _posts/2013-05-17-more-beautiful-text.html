Getting a wider array of fonts into your website is a pretty simple task these days. There's quite a selection of fonts that you can use offered on the web. Just take a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/">Google's repository</a>&nbsp;to see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Once you've selected the font that's right for your application, you can import it to pages using the following directive:<br /><br /><pre>@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Sans:400,700);</pre><br />... and then finally use it in your css directives.<br /><br /><pre>font-family: "Droid Sans", arial, verdana, sans-serif;</pre><br />Easy.</div>
