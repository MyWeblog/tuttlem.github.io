Another cool routine built off of some relatively simple mathematics is the mandelbrot set. Wikipedia has a really good write up if you're a little rusty on the ins and outs of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">mandelbrot set</a>.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p31g56qoaeA/ULnOyLAQItI/AAAAAAAAAiA/U2LUMbXz0ic/s1600/Screen+Shot+2012-12-01+at+7.31.22+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="265" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-p31g56qoaeA/ULnOyLAQItI/AAAAAAAAAiA/U2LUMbXz0ic/s400/Screen+Shot+2012-12-01+at+7.31.22+PM.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /><br />This tutorial assumes that you've already got a video display ready with a pointer to your buffer.&nbsp;We'll just focus on the function that makes the doughnuts. Here's the code, explanation to follow. This code has been lifted out of a file that I had in an old dos program. It was written using turbo C, but will port over to anything pretty easily.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the code!<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4181270.js?file=gistfile1.c"></script> <br /><br />So, you can see this code is very simple - to the point. We need to investigate all of the pixels (in this case 320x200 - or 64,000) and we calculate the iteration intersection at each point.<br /><br />The variables passed into the function allows the caller to animate the mandelbrot. "zoom" will take you further into the pattern, "xofs" and "yofs" will translate your position by this (x,y) pair. "max_iter" just determines how many cycles the caller wants to spend working out the iteration count. A higher number means that the plot comes out more detailed, but it slower to generate.<br /><br />Anyway, only a quick one - don't want to hold you up. Go make something cool!<br /><br /></div>
