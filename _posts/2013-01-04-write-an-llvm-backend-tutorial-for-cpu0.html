One day, when I get a chance I will get through this entire article and actually give it a crack, but, until they invent the 48 hour day I'm stuck with just making a bookmark post.<br /><br />I've scratched the surface of this article and it's comprehensive. Really very interesting if it's your sort of thing.<br /><br /><a href="http://jonathan2251.github.com/lbd/index.html">http://jonathan2251.github.com/lbd/index.html</a></div>
