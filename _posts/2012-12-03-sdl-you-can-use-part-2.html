<h3>Introduction</h3>In a <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/sdl-you-can-use-part-1.html">previous post</a>, we had put together a simple build system and we have a window displaying the screen for a short moment - then we're done.<br /><br />Today, we're going to change that fixed delay that the window shows for and make it&nbsp;dependent&nbsp;on when the user wants to quit the application. To do this, I'll be introducing the concept of SDL events.<br /><br />As we're doing this, I'll be able to show you other purposes (or other events) that SDL's eventing system has to offer.<br /><h3>Events and Eventing</h3><div>Events are SDL's way of sending information between the operating system and your application. The SDL library site has a <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/intro.en/usingevents.html">short and concise write-up</a> about their events system. &nbsp;All of the events available can be found <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/docs/html/eventstructures.html">here</a>. Reading over this list should give you a pretty good idea of what information is supported when using SDL. You'll receive information for:</div><div><ul><li>When the application activates</li><li>When you receive keyboard input</li><li>When the mouse is actioned</li><li>When the joystick is actioned</li><li>When the application's window is resized</li><li>When platform dependent information is sent</li><li>When the application requests to quit.</li></ul><div>There isn't much out of list that we won't need. If we do get stuck, we always have <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/docs/html/sdluserevent.html">SDL_UserEvent</a>&nbsp;available to us to send custom information.</div></div><h3>What's it look like?</h3><div>Now that all of the wordy stuff is out of the way, it's time to show you how to put one of these message loops together. That's just it though, it's just a very simple little loop. I've commented this code pretty well so it shouldn't need too much explanation. This code should come directly after your window's (video's) successful creation.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4191175.js?file=gistfile1.c"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The user will now be able to control to lifespan of the application by issuing a quit request to the application. That's much better than just keeping it open for 2 seconds, then quitting.<br /><h3>That's it!</h3></div><div>So, we're still not doing anything uber-exciting. That will come though. We have a few sibling topics to cover now that we've established an application-host (window + event loop). We've got audio, input, network, openGL!</div><div><br /></div></div>
