[scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) is a specialist library for dealing with mathematical, science and engineering problems. According to their website:

> The SciPy library, a collection of numerical algorithms and domain-specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more.

The library itself is such a broad topic, so for the purposes of today's article I just want to focus on a few items (from numpy) listed in their [basic functions](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/basic.html) area covering [polynomials](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/basic.html#polynomials) and then finish up with the [integration](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/integrate.html#general-integration-quad) library.

## Polynomials

A quick brush-up on some high school math *(thanks wikipedia)* tells us that a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) is an expression of more than two algebraic terms; these are normally variables (or indeterminates) and co-efficients. 

Our polynomial with just one variable:

{% highlight text %}
x² + 3x + 1
{% endhighlight %}

Let's get scipy to represent this for us:

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np

p1 = np.poly1d([1, 3, 1])
print(p1)
{% endhighlight %}

This gives us an output of:

{% highlight text %}
   2
1 x + 3 x + 1
{% endhighlight %}

## Derivative

Lets derive this function, to find the formula that defines its instantaneous rate of change:

{% highlight text %}
f(x)  = x² + 3x + 1
f'(x) = 2x + 3
{% endhighlight %}

We can get scipy to this for us using the [deriv](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.poly1d.deriv.html) function:

{% highlight python %}
print(p1.deriv())
{% endhighlight %}

Confirming everything for us, we now receive the derivative:

{% highlight text %}
2 x + 3
{% endhighlight %}

## Integral

We'll integrate the same function now, providing us with the ability to calculate the area under the curve that the original polynomial would provide:

{% highlight text %}
 f(x) = x² + 3x + 1
∫f(x) = x³ / 3 + (3x²) / 2 + x + C
{% endhighlight %} 

We can simply use the [integ](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.poly1d.integ.html) function to do this for us, again:

{% highlight python %}
print(p1.integ())
{% endhighlight %}

Providing us with the following answer:

{% highlight text %}
        3       2
0.3333 x + 1.5 x + 1 x
{% endhighlight %}

## General integration

Now that we've done some basic calculus with polynomials, we'll get scipy to perform the integration for us. Using [quad](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.quad.html#scipy.integrate.quad) we specify the function that produces our values a maxima and minima value and then we're given the integrated values.

We'll simplify with `x²`.

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
import scipy.integrate as integrate

f = np.poly1d([1, 0, 0])
result = integrate.quad(f, 0, 1)
{% endhighlight %}

We're then given the following:

{% highlight text %}
(0.33333333333333337, 3.700743415417189e-15)
{% endhighlight %}

To my eye, the answer is `⅓`, and performing the basic subtraction I'm given: `0.33333333333332965`. Pretty close?

This has been a really light-on tour of Scipy!
