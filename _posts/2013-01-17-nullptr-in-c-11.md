It happened! It finally happened! `NULL` has a real identity within the language. Forever I'd used the notion of `NULL` in my C & C++ to really mean `0` (zero) under the covers.

{% highlight cpp %}
#define NULL 0
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, I'd never defined it myself. It was always done for me in one of the many include files drawn into my program. One of the problems with this particular define is for overloaded methods. If you were to pass `NULL` in its defined state above, you'd be guessing as to which overload is called.

{% highlight cpp %}
void useptr(float* p) { /*...*/ }
void useptr(char* p) { /*...*/ }

// float* or char*??
useptr(NULL);
{% endhighlight %}

Well, now we have `nullptr` in C++11. `nullptr` is castable to any pointer type.

{% highlight cpp %}
int* p = nullptr;
char* str = nullptr;
person* someone = nullptr;
{% endhighlight %}

The castability also covers off on boolean expressions, so the following if-trees will still work.

{% highlight cpp %}
if (!p) {
  cout << "p was null!";
}
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, `nullptr` is of type `nullptr_t`. If you're going to find it of use to you to guarantee that a null pointer is going to be passed into a method, you could type your method using the type `nullptr_t`.

Null now has a home.
