There are a few tools at a developers disposal to perform queries that go cross-database. In today's post, I'll quickly go over using [dblink](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/dblink.html) to establish links between [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) databases. 

## Example Usage

First up, we need to make sure that the dblink extension is available to our server. `CREATE EXTENSION` is what we'll use to do this:

{% highlight sql %}
CREATE EXTENSION dblink;
{% endhighlight %}

Prior to being able to query against a remote database, we need to use [dblink_connect](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/contrib-dblink-connect.html) to establish a link from the local context.

{% highlight sql %}
-- create the crumbs link
select  dblink_connect(
    'remotedb',
    'host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=remotedb user=postgres password=password'
);
{% endhighlight %}

The connection string that you supply are fairly straight forward details to connect to a server with given credentials.

Using [dblink](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/contrib-dblink-function.html), you can now invoke a query on the remote server and have the result mixed into your local code.

{% highlight sql %}
select  *
from    dblink('remotedb', 'SELECT "ID", "Name" FROM "People"')
as      people("ID" int4, "Name" character varying);
{% endhighlight %}


When you're done with the connection, you use [dblink_disconnect](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/contrib-dblink-disconnect.html).

{% highlight sql %}
select dblink_disconnect('dbl-crumbs');  
{% endhighlight %}

## Async Queries 

dblink also gives you the opportunity to perform async queries which is really handy. You kick the query off, do something and then start fetching the results later on in your code.

{% highlight sql %}
/* start the query off */
select  *
from    dblink_send_query('remotedb', 'SELECT "ID", "Name" FROM "People"')
as      people;

/* Do some other work here */

/* start drawing the results */
select  *
from    dblink_get_reslut('remotedb')
as      people("ID" int4, "Name" character varying);
{% endhighlight %}

That's a bit fancy.
