You can start an internal web server that will serve all of your installed gemsets' documentation simply by issuing the following command at the console.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem server
Server started at http://0.0.0.0:8808
{% endhighlight %}

Point your web browers to the machine on port 8808 and you're away!
