Getting your program to make simple [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) has become a feature that is just *a given* these days. The python library [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) makes life a lot easier. 

> Requests is the only Non-GMO HTTP library for Python, safe for human consumption.

Today's post will focus on this library, to show you how you can be immediately productive.

## How things were

One of the best comparisons comes directly from the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) documentation. Prior to its existence, you needed to do the following to perform a `GET` request with [Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication):

{% highlight python %}
import urllib2

gh_url = 'https://api.github.com'

req = urllib2.Request(gh_url)

password_manager = urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm()
password_manager.add_password(None, gh_url, 'user', 'pass')

auth_manager = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler(password_manager)
opener = urllib2.build_opener(auth_manager)

urllib2.install_opener(opener)

handler = urllib2.urlopen(req)

print handler.getcode()
print handler.headers.getheader('content-type')
{% endhighlight %}

Bringing this code forward to use the **requests** library, the code simplifies:

{% highlight python %}
import requests

r = requests.get('https://api.github.com', auth=('user', 'pass'))

print r.status_code
print r.headers['content-type']
{% endhighlight %}

Clearly, you can see that the code using the **requests** library is far simpler. Let's look at some more examples.

## Simple verbs

The simple verbs can be used quite simply by name:

{% highlight python %}
requests.get('http://api.me.com/people/1')
requests.put('http://api.me.com/people/1', data = { 'name': 'john' })
requests.post('http://api.me.com/people', data = { 'name': 'john' })
requests.delete('http://api.me.com/people/1')
{% endhighlight %}

Of course the likes of `OPTIONS` and `HEAD` are also available.

## Finishing up

The rest of this blog post could easily replicate all of the content in the documentation, but instead I'll link to all of **the good stuff**:
