    <h1>Pygame Part 5 Music</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>In the previous article in this series, we were talking about adding sound effects to our games for that extra level of immersion. Sounds effects really do add that needed atmosphere to your game, but so does music. Music provides the perfect ambient touch to that game scene or just gives you an excuse to get your "8-bit" on!</div><div><br /></div><div>In today's post, we'll load some music from disk and play it while our ball is moving around the screen.&nbsp;We'll be using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV">WAV format</a> today for our media.<br /><br /><h3>Get loaded</h3></div><div>Using our code from the last article, all we need to do is issue a call to <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html#pygame.mixer.music.load">pygame.mixer.music.load</a>&nbsp;to get the wave file off disk and into memory. Once we've done this, we can start playing the loaded music track using <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html#pygame.mixer.music.play">pygame.mixer.music.play</a>. It takes a few parameters specific to playing the track, but for our purposes we'll play the track once and that's it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's the code.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/5023016.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>So now our ball is flying around the window with Toto cranking out "Africa" in the background. Awesome :)<br /><br />Very simple code but very effective in adding atmosphere, ambience and emotion to your digital landscape.</div></div>

    <h1>Pygame Part 4 Sounding Off</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>Welcome to part 4 in this pygame series. We've been very visual so far, centring all of our topics on video-based items. Today's post, we're going to talk about audio and getting it integrated into your game. Sound effects are a great way to add atmosphere to your game and games just wouldn't be right without it. It's also very simple to get up and running.</div><div><br /></div><div>Just a final introductory point, we'll be using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV">WAV format</a> today as our media. Looking at the <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html">documentation for the sound module</a> in pygame, it appears that you can also use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg">OGG format</a>.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Loading a sound</h3><div>The first thing you'll need to do is to initialize the mixer framework. All of this leans on the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">SDL_mixer</a> module, so if you've done some <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> before, this will all be very familiar (but much easier). We'll use <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html#pygame.mixer.init">pygame.mixer.init</a> to initialize the mixer module before use. It takes in all of the usuals (which you can read up on in the documentation), but they're all defaulted nicely for quick use. We'll then load a sound by creating a new Sound object using <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html#pygame.mixer.Sound">pygame.mixer.Sound</a>. The Sound object has all of the functions of immediate use to us like <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html#Sound.play">play</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>We'll be using the code from <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/pygame-part-3-loading-image.html">Tutorial 3</a> here. The bouncing object around the screen is going to make a sound whenever it hits a boundary. Sounds pretty straight-forward, and it is. Here's the code.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/5022653.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div>And that's it really. You can see the calls to play, placed inside of the if blocks for when the ball is detected at the boundaries. I would screenshot this application as a picture for this article, but it's pretty useless to do so as it's an article on sound!<br /><br />Have fun.</div></div>

    <h1>Pygame Part 3 Loading An Image</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>In the previous tutorials in this series, we learnt how to <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/pygame-part-1-window.html">open a window</a> and how to <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/pygame-part-2-eventing.html">respond to the quit event</a>. In today's post, we're going to actually put something on the screen!</div><div><br /></div><div>Depending on how your pygame installation has been applied, you may or may not have access to load different sorts of graphic formats into your game. For today's purposes, I'll just be loading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format">bitmap format</a> (BMP) - seems pretty common amongst a lot of people's installations.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Images</h3><div>To load and work with images in our game, we'll be employing the help of the <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/image.html">pygame.image</a> module. The <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/image.html#pygame.image.load">load function</a>&nbsp;in this module takes in a path to where your image is on disk and returns you a <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html">Surface</a> with your image loaded up on it. The other item of interest in the example code is that because we have been returned a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html">Surface</a>, we get all of the goodies that come along with it including being able to get the rectangle that bounds the image so we can measure it on screen.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's the code.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/4985286.js"></script></div><div><br /><br />This still hasn't changed much through all of these posts. You'll see that actually getting the image involved in your game is achieved by using the <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#Surface.blit">blit</a> function which draws a surface to another using a rectangle.<br /><br />Providing your image is called spot and it's a blue ball, you should have something like this:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eXL7kfPAjxk/USNsSXZqX5I/AAAAAAAAAmw/YaAlL7XXgB4/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-02-19+at+10.11.52+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="277" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eXL7kfPAjxk/USNsSXZqX5I/AAAAAAAAAmw/YaAlL7XXgB4/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-02-19+at+10.11.52+PM.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />That's about it really.<br /><br /></div></div>

    <h1>Pygame Part 2 Eventing</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>In my <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/pygame-part-1-window.html">previous post</a>&nbsp;in this article series, we created a window and repeatedly painted black to the screen. A major flaw had crept into this application already. We weren't considering the operating system what so ever and therefore this made for a very unresponsive application.</div><div><br /></div><div>Events help our pygame applications respond to "things" that happen. This could be a key being pressed, the mouse being moved or simply that a quit message was sent to the application.</div><div><br /></div><div>Today's post will focus on processing events in our pygame application.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Listening for Events</h3><div>The <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html">documentation</a> on the event module in pygame is quite extensive. It covers everything off in the API and is the perfect reference for when you're stuck. We're interested in <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html#pygame.event.poll">pygame.event.poll</a> for our purposes. We'll use this function to continuously check for events of interest that have occurred.</div><div><br /></div><div>The only change from our initial code is that our game is controlled by a boolean as to weather it is still running or not. That variable then gets flipped if a quit message is detected by the framework.</div><div><br /></div><div>Here's the code.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/4976682.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>This is a pretty simple example and don't let it fool you. The eventing system will cover all of your needs as far as responding to in-game actions.<br /><br />Running this code, the application will now respond to the operating system and will terminate gracefully when it receives a quit message.<br /><br />Simple.</div></div>

    <h1>Pygame Part 1 The Window</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>It's easy to be productive when you've got good tools. I've forever been building game engines in an attempt that I'll actually put it to use one day to write a game. The constant distraction is adding just the "1 feature more" which in turn ends up stopping you from actually writing a game. It's time to look for help.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pygame.org/">Pygame</a> is exactly what someone like me needs to squeeze the excuses. With a fully-featured game library, there's no more needing to build the library - all you need to do is be productive writing your game!</div><div><br /></div><div>I hope to put together a handful of tutorials that I can come back to at anytime and already have a head start.&nbsp;These tutorials will assume that you already have a pygame environment up and running. There's plenty of tutorials around the traps already to get you on your way, I've even done one for OSX <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/pygame-virtualenv-pip-homebrew.html">here</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>To start off, today's tutorial will do nothing more than get a window on screen, repeatedly painting black.</div><div><br /></div><h3>The code</h3><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/4970913.js"></script> You can see here that getting a window up and running is very straight forward. We initialise the framework, setup the display and start painting.<br /><br />All going well, if you run this code from your console, you should end up with something like this.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-da79gYox4Lo/USCxara_UzI/AAAAAAAAAmg/N4XkUsss3ss/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-02-17+at+8.30.28+PM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="277" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-da79gYox4Lo/USCxara_UzI/AAAAAAAAAmg/N4XkUsss3ss/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-02-17+at+8.30.28+PM.png" width="320" /></a></div>That's it. Couldn't be easier!<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
