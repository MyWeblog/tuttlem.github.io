Noteworthy without this article is Lockless (<a href="http://locklessinc.com/articles/gcc_asm/">http://locklessinc.com/</a>) for the great super-technical write-ups that they do.

Inlining assembly language using the GNU toolset has always escaped me (until now). It's not so much that I didn't know how to do it, I just felt it much more comfortable to write my assembly in a separately linked object. This article has put my mind, stomach and C blending assembly fingers at ease.
