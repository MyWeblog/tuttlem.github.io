### Introduction

The [Scala Programming Language](http://www.scala-lang.org/) is a language that brings together [object oriented concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) with [functional programming concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) on top of the [jvm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine).

In today's post, I'm going to go through some basic concepts of the language.

### Classes

For our example, we'll define a `Player` class. This will hold our player's `name`, `height` and `weight` which won't change once we set them. Note that we're using the `val` keyword in the parameter list of the default constructor for the class. This automatically generates immutable members for us accessing this information.

{% highlight scala %}
class Player(val name: String, val height: Int, val weight: Int) {

  def getMessage(): String = "Game on!"

  def talk(): Unit = {
    val message = this.getMessage()
    println(s"$name the player says '$message'")
  }

}
{% endhighlight %}

We've also given our player the ability to `talk`. The player also has a message to say with `getMessage`.

### Inheritance

We can inherit from this base `Player` class and define a `Forward` and a `Back`.

{% highlight scala %}
class Forward(name: String, height: Int, weight: Int) extends Player(name, height, weight) {
  override def getMessage(): String = "Uggg!"
}

class Back(name: String, height: Int, weight: Int) extends Player(name, height, weight) {
  override def getMessage(): String = "How does my hair look?"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Forwards and backs say different things, so we have overridden the default `getMessage` implementation in each case.

### Traits

A `trait` is similar to the `interface` that you'd find in other languages. The main difference to a strict interface, is that a trait **can** have implementation. In the following example, the `ValueEmitter` trait is applied to different types of objects, but it commonly utilised to equate an answer.

{% highlight scala %}
trait ValueEmitter {
  def value(): Double
}
{% endhighlight %}

To represent a literal value and an operation both using this trait, we apply it to classes:

{% highlight scala %}
class LiteralValue(v: Double) extends ValueEmitter {
  def value(): Double = v
}

class Operation(val v1: ValueEmitter, val v2: ValueEmitter, val op: String) extends ValueEmitter {
  def value(): Double = {
    val left = v1.value()
    val right = v2.value()

    op match {
      case "+" => left + right
      case "-" => left - right
      case "*" => left * right
      case "/" => left / right
      case default => 0
    }
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Case Classes

Case classes allow you to concisely condense the definitions above:

{% highlight scala %}
abstract class ValueEmitter
case class LiteralValue(v: Double) extends ValueEmitter
case class Operation(v1: ValueEmitter, v2: ValueEmitter, op: String) extends ValueEmitter
{% endhighlight %}

This syncs up really well with the pattern matching ideas.

### Pattern Matching

Following on with the example in **Case Classes**, we'll write a function that uses pattern matching to ensure we're getting the correct type through. Also see that we can pattern match on the values being passed through; not just the type.

{% highlight scala %}
def calculate(v: ValueEmitter): Double = v match {
  case LiteralValue(lv) => lv
  case Operation(v1, v2, "/") => {
    throw new Exception("I do not support divide")
  }
  case Operation(v1, v2, op) => {
    val left = calculate(v1)
    val right = calculate(v2)

    op match {
      case "+" => left + right
      case "-" => left - right
      case "*" => left * right
      case "/" => left / right
      case default => 0
    }

  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Object

Static classes (or singleton objects) are just a way of defining single-use classes. You'll see `main` sitting within an `object` definition rather than seeing `main` declared statically.

{% highlight scala %}
object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, world")
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Another demonstrative use case for these objects is a configuration class:

{% highlight scala %}
object Config {
  def transactionDb(): String = "postgres://blah/xyz"
  def objectStoreDb(): String = "mongodb://quxx/abc"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Both `transactionDb` and `objectStoreDb` become accessible when prefixed with `Config.`.

### Accessors

You can short cut the creation of your accessors using your default constructor. As you'd expect, you use `val` for immutable, read-only properties and `var` for the read/write items.

{% highlight scala %}
class StockPrice(val code: String, var price: Double) {
}
{% endhighlight %}

The `code` on the stock doesn't change but its `price` does.

These accessors can be defined manually using the following convention; this also allows you to specify any code that needs to execute within these accessors:

{% highlight scala %}
class StockPrice(val code: String, val initialPrice: Double) {

  private var _price: Double = initialPrice;

  def price: Double = _price
  def price_= (value: Double): Unit = {
    _price = value
  }

}
{% endhighlight %}

This is only a really small sample of the scala language, but will certainly get you up and running pretty quickly.
