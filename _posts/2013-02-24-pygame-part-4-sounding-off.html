<h3>Introduction</h3><div>Welcome to part 4 in this pygame series. We've been very visual so far, centring all of our topics on video-based items. Today's post, we're going to talk about audio and getting it integrated into your game. Sound effects are a great way to add atmosphere to your game and games just wouldn't be right without it. It's also very simple to get up and running.</div><div><br /></div><div>Just a final introductory point, we'll be using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV">WAV format</a> today as our media. Looking at the <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html">documentation for the sound module</a> in pygame, it appears that you can also use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg">OGG format</a>.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Loading a sound</h3><div>The first thing you'll need to do is to initialize the mixer framework. All of this leans on the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/">SDL_mixer</a> module, so if you've done some <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a> before, this will all be very familiar (but much easier). We'll use <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html#pygame.mixer.init">pygame.mixer.init</a> to initialize the mixer module before use. It takes in all of the usuals (which you can read up on in the documentation), but they're all defaulted nicely for quick use. We'll then load a sound by creating a new Sound object using <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html#pygame.mixer.Sound">pygame.mixer.Sound</a>. The Sound object has all of the functions of immediate use to us like <a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html#Sound.play">play</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>We'll be using the code from <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/pygame-part-3-loading-image.html">Tutorial 3</a> here. The bouncing object around the screen is going to make a sound whenever it hits a boundary. Sounds pretty straight-forward, and it is. Here's the code.</div><div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/5022653.js"></script></div><div><br /></div><div>And that's it really. You can see the calls to play, placed inside of the if blocks for when the ball is detected at the boundaries. I would screenshot this application as a picture for this article, but it's pretty useless to do so as it's an article on sound!<br /><br />Have fun.</div></div>
