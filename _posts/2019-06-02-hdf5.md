In today's article, we'll talk a bit about the [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) format. From the HDF5 website:

> An HDF5 file is a container for two kinds of objects: datasets, which are array-like collections of data, and groups, which are folder-like containers that hold datasets and other groups.
