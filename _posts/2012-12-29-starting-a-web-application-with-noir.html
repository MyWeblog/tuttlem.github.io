<h3>Introduction</h3><div>Looking for something semi-useful to do with my <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/clojure-and-leiningen-quickstart.html">new installation of Clojure and Leiningen</a>, I thought I'd have a hunt around and look for some web frameworks that I might be able to put a small application together with. The web did not disappoint offering me options of <a href="http://www.webnoir.org/">Noir</a>, <a href="http://www.joodoweb.com/">Joodo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tatut/Webjure">Webjure</a>, <a href="https://github.com/macourtney/Conjure">Conjure</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/moustache">Moustache</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>A feast of frameworks indeed. I looked at all of them very briefly but decided to only investigate one, Noir. I'm sure all of the other frameworks have their benefits over&nbsp;Noir, I just wanted to start somewhere.</div><div><br /></div><div>This post is actually about getting the the&nbsp;Noir&nbsp;Leiningen template installed and getting your first application started. The Noir website will be able to take you further steps.</div><div><br /></div><div>For this post, I'm using <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">homebrew</a> on Mac OSX 10.8.2.<br /><br />My Leiningen version is 1.7.1<br />My Clojure version is 1.4.0</div><div><br /></div><h3>Installation</h3><div>There's no real installation about it. If you have Leiningen installed, you're almost there. I did need some extra help installing the correct template to make Leiningen generate the correct structure for a Noir project.<br /><br />I installed the Noir Leiningen template</div><div><pre>$ lein plugin install noir/lein-template 1.3.0 </pre></div><div><br /></div><div><br /><div>Then I installed the newnew template</div><div><pre>$ lein plugin install lein-newnew 0.2.6 </pre></div><div></div></div><div><br />It was at this point, that I was ready to go!<br /><br /><h3>Get going!</h3></div><div>You should now be able to issue the following instructions at the shell and have a running web application.</div><div><br /></div><div><pre>$ lein new noir my-website</pre><pre>$ cd my-website</pre><pre>$ lein run</pre><br />Your turn! :-)</div></div>
