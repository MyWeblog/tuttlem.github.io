I needed to make a note of this particular link. Hoogle is a search engine for looking up API calls and modules. It's quite a neat search engine.

[http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/](http://www.haskell.org/hoogle/)

[HackageDB](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html) is also a great resource for looking at Haskell packages in cabal format.
