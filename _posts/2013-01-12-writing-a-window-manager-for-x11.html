As a bit of a bookmark to myself, I just wanted to post about writing a window manager for X windows. A lot of the material that I've seen around the place in articles and posts themselves have all pointed me towards downloading the out-of-print <a href="http://oreilly.com/openbook/">O'Reilly Open Book</a> site.<br /><br />Some of the books of interest to a window manager programmer are<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/xlibretmanver1102nyemiss">Xlib Reference Manual</a></li><li><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/xlibrefmanv115ed02nyemiss">Xlib Reference Manual Volume 2</a></li><li><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/xtoolkitintrinsi04nyemiss">X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming Manual</a></li><li><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/xtoolkitintrirefman05oreimiss">X Toolkit Intrinsics Reference Manual</a></li></ul><div>I'm sure that there is plenty of other reference material around, but a lot of people were suggesting to put a copy of these in your claw - so I have.</div><div><br /></div><div>Digging around a little bit more, I came across <a href="http://incise.org/tinywm.html">TinyWM</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://incise.org/tinywm.html">TinyWM</a>&nbsp;looks like a suitable candidate to be the bootstrap to a window manager project.
