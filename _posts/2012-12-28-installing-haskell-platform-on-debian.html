If you are only using the stable repositories for your Debian installation, you'll have an older version of haskell-platform running on your system. In this post, I'll show you how to enable the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable">unstable</a>&nbsp;repository and get the latest version of <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/haskell-platform">haskell-platform</a> installed.<br /><br />First up, you need to enable the unstable repository by adding the following line to your /etc/apt/sources.list<br /><br /><pre>deb http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/debian/ unstable main</pre><br />You should replace the mirror that I've specified above with one that is suitably close to where installation commands are executing.<br /><br />Next, if one doesn't yet exist, create a /etc/apt/preferences file and edit it. Once you're editing, add the following lines to set apt's preferences as to which repository it will favor<br /><br /><pre>Package: *<br />Pin: release a=squeeze   <br />Pin-Priority: 900<br /><br />Package: *<br />Pin: release a=unstable <br />Pin-Priority: 800</pre><br />So, the stable repository (squeeze) is still in charge overall but unstable packages will be available to you at request.<br /><br />Update aptitude's package database now from the newly added repository<br /><br /><pre># aptitude update</pre><br />A very handy tid-bit at this point is that you'll now be able to see all of the versions of a package that are available to you with respect to their originating respository.<br /><br /><pre>$ aptitude versions haskell-platform<br />p   2010.1.0.0.1                                  stable                    500<br />i   2012.2.0.0                                    unstable                  800<br /></pre><br />Finally, you can get to installing the&nbsp;<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/haskell-platform">haskell-platform</a>&nbsp;package from the unstable repository<br /><br /><pre># aptitude install haskell-platform/unstable</pre><br />That's it. You're ready to go.</div>
