    <h1>Getting started with GLUT in Linux</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/">GLUT</a> is the OpenGL Utility Toolkit which is a standard set of APIs that you should be able to use on any platform to write OpenGL programs. It takes care of the boilerplate code that your applications would need to integrate with the host windowing system. More can be found about GLUT on its <a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/">website</a>.<br /><br />Today's post, I'll focus on getting your Linux environment up to speed to start writing programs with this framework.<br /><br /><h3>Installation</h3>In order to write programs using this library, you'll need to install the development library. Using your favorite package manager, you'll need to install freeglut.<br /><br /><pre class="brush: shell">$ sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev<br /></pre><br />After that's finished, it's time to write a test application to make sure everything went to plan.<br /><br /><h3>A Simple Example</h3>The following program will just open a window and continually clear the window.<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/8156737.js"></script> <br />Putting this code into "test.c", we built it into a program with the following command:<br /><br /><pre class="brush: shell">$ gcc test.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut -o test<br /></pre><br />That's it! Run "test" at the command prompt and if everything has gone to plan, you've installed freeglut correctly!<br /><br /></div>

    <h1>Diving into OpenCL</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div>In a <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/11/setup-debian-for-opencl-development.html">previous article</a>&nbsp;I'd put together a walk through on how to get your development environment ready to write some <a href="http://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a> code. This article by itself isn't of much use unless you can write some code already.</div><div><br /></div><div>Today's post will be a walk through on writing your first OpenCL program. This example, much like a lot of the other entry-level OpenCL development tutorials will focus on performing addition between two lists of floating point numbers.</div><br /><h3>Lots to learn</h3><div>Unfortunately, OpenCL is a topic that brings a very steep learning curve. In order to understand even the most simple of programs you need to read a fair bit of code and hopefully be aware of what it's doing. Before we dive into any implementation, I'll take you on a brief tour of terms, types and definitions that will help you to understanding the code as it's presented.<br /><br /><br /></div><b>cl_platform_id</b><br /><div>A cl_platform_id is obtained using <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clGetPlatformIDs.html">clGetPlatformIDs</a>. A platform in OpenCL refers to the host execution environment and any attached devices. Platforms are what allow OpenCL to share resources and execute programs.<br /><br /></div><b>cl_device_id</b><br /><div>A cl_device_id is obtained using <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clGetDeviceIDs.html">clGetDeviceIDs</a>. It's how your program will refer to the devices that your code will run on. A device is how OpenCL refers to "something" that will execute code (CPU, GPU, etc).<br /><br /></div><b>cl_context</b><br /><div>A cl_context is obtained using <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clCreateContext.html">clCreateContext</a>. A context is established across OpenCL devices. It's what OpenCL will use to manage command-queues, memory, program and kernel objects. It provides the ability to execute a kernel across many devices.<br /><br /></div><b>cl_program</b><br /><div>A cl_program is created from actual (string) source-code at runtime using <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clCreateProgramWithSource.html">clCreateProgramWithSource</a>. They're created in conjunction with your context so that program creation is aware of where it'll be expected to run.</div><div><br /></div><div>After the cl_program reference is successfully established, the host program would typically call <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clBuildProgram.html">clBuildProgram</a>&nbsp;to take the program from its source code (string) state into an executable (binary) state.<br /><br /></div><b>cl_command_queue</b><br /><div>A cl_command_queue is established using <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clCreateCommandQueue.html">clCreateCommandQueue</a>. A command queue is how work is scheduled to a device for execution. <br /><br /></div><b>cl_kernel</b><br /><div>A cl_kernel is created using <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clCreateKernel.html">clCreateKernel</a>. A kernel is a function contained within a compiled cl_program object. It's identified within the source code with a __kernel qualifier. You set the argument list for a cl_kernel object using <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clSetKernelArg.html">clSetKernelArg</a>. To glue it all together, you use <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clEnqueueNDRangeKernel.html">clEnqueueNDRangeKernel</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clEnqueueTask.html">clEnqueueTask</a>&nbsp;to enqueue a task on the command queue to execute a kernel.</div><div><br /></div><div>A side note here is that you can use <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/clEnqueueNativeKernel.html">clEnqueueNativeKernel</a>&nbsp;to execute native C/C++ code that isn't compiled by OpenCL.</div><div><br /></div><div>At least if you can identify some form of meaning when you come across these type names, you won't be totally in the dark. Next up, we'll create a host program and OpenCL routine - compile, build and run!</div><br /><h3>The Host</h3><div>The host application is responsible for engaging with the OpenCL api to setup all of the objects described above. It's also responsible for locating the OpenCL source code and making it available for compilation at run time.<br /><br />In this first snippet of code, we use the OpenCL api to establish the management platform and devices that are available to execute our code. Majority of the OpenCL api standardises itself around returning error codes from all of the functions.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7669868.js"></script></div>At this point, we have "platform" which will (<i>hopefully</i>) contain a platform ID identifying our management platform and "device" should either refer to the GPU or CPU (failing to find a GPU).<br /><div><br />The next step is to create a context and your OpenCL program from source.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7669938.js"></script></div>We've done just that here, but the program isn't quite yet ready for execution. Before we can start using this, we need to build the program. The build process is very much a compilation &amp; linking process that involves its own set of log message outputs, etc. You can make this part of your program as elaborate as you'd like. Here's an example compilation process.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7670168.js"></script> We've got a platform, device, context and program that's been built. We now need to shift contexts from the host program to the actual OpenCL code that we'll execute for the purposes of this example. We need to understand what the inputs, outputs, used resources, etc. of the OpenCL code is before we can continue to write the rest of our host. <br /><br /><h3>The OpenCL Code</h3><div>The main purpose of OpenCL code is really to operate arithmetically on arrays (or strings) of data. The example that I'm suggesting for the purposes of this article takes in two source arrays and produces another array which are the sum of each index. i.e.<br /><br /><pre>c[0] = a[0]&nbsp;+ b[0]<br />c[1] = a[1]&nbsp;+ b[1]<br />. . .<br />. . .<br /></pre><br />As above, the source arrays are "a" and "b". The result array (holding the sum of each source array at each index) is "c".<br /><br />Here's the (rather simple) OpenCL code to achieve this.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7675033.js"></script></div>That's all there is to it. Things to note are, any function that is to be called in the OpenCL context is called a "kernel". Kernel's must be decorated with the "__kernel" modifier. In this example, the parameters that are passed in are decorated with the "__global" modifier. This tells OpenCL that these are objects allocated from the global memory pool. You can read up more about these modifiers <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/global.html">here</a>.<br /><br />The final thing to note is the use of <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.0/docs/man/xhtml/get_global_id.html">get_global_id</a>. It's what gives us the particular index to process in our array here. The parameter that's supplies allows you to work with 1, 2 or 3 dimensional arrays. Anything over this, the arrays need to be broken down to use a smaller dimension count.<br /><div><br /><h3>Back to the Host</h3></div><div>Back in context of the host, we'll create the command queue and kernel objects. The command queue allows us to send commands to OpenCL like reading &amp; writing to buffers or executing kernel code. The following code shows the creation of the command queue and kernel.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7675267.js"></script> Notice that we mentioned the kernel by name here. A kernel object refers to the function!<br /><br />Now that we have a function to execute (or kernel) we now need to be able to pass data to the function. We also need to be able to read the result once processing has finished. Our first job is allocating buffers that OpenCL will be aware of to handle these arrays.</div><div><br /></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7675181.js"></script> <br /><div><br /></div>In the above snippet, we've defined the source arrays and we've also created buffers that will hold the information (for use in our OpenCL code). Now all we need to do is to feed the source arrays into the buffers and supply all of the buffers as arguments to our kernel.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7675340.js"></script> Now we invoke OpenCL to do the work. In doing this, we need to supply the invocation with a global size and local size. Global size is used to specify the total number of work items being processed. In our case, this is ARRAY_SIZE. Local size is used as the number of work items in each local group. Local size needs to be a divisor of global size. For simplicity, I've set these both to "ARRAY_SIZE".<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7675450.js"></script> After all of the work is completed, we really want to take a look at the result. We'll send another request to the command queue to read that result array back into local storage. From there, we'll be able to print the results to screen.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7675493.js"></script> Fantastic. Everything's on screen now, we can see the results. All we'll do from here is clean up our mess and get out.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7675542.js"></script> <br />What a marathon! Hopefully you've learnt something from this post. It's a lot to take in to get a "Hello, World" level application up and running.<br /><div><br /></div></div>

    <h1>Setup Debian for OpenCL Development</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3><div><a href="http://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a> (or Open Computing Language) is a framework that allows you to write code across different connected devices to your computer. Code that you write can execute on CPUs, GPUs, DPSs amongst other pieces of hardware. The framework itself is a standard that puts the focus on running your code across these devices but also emphasises parallel computing.</div><div><br /></div><div>Today's post will just be on getting your development environment setup on Debian Wheezy to start writing some code.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Installation</h3><div>The installation process is pretty straight forward, but there are some choices in libraries. The major vendors (Intel, NVIDIA and AMD) all have development libraries that are installable from Debian's package repository. There's plenty of banter on the internet as to who's is better for what purpose.</div><div><br /></div><div>First off, we need to install the header files we'll use to create OpenCL programs.</div><div><br /><pre class="brush: shell">$ sudo apt-get install opencl-headers</pre><br /></div><div>This has now put all of the development headers in place for you to compile some code.<br /><br /><pre class="brush: plain">$ ls -al /usr/include/CL<br />total 1060<br />drwxr-xr-x  2 root root   4096 Nov 25 22:51 .<br />drwxr-xr-x 56 root root   4096 Nov 25 22:51 ..<br />-rw-r--r--  1 root root   4859 Nov 15  2011 cl_d3d10.h<br />-rw-r--r--  1 root root   4853 Apr 18  2012 cl_d3d11.h<br />-rw-r--r--  1 root root   5157 Apr 18  2012 cl_dx9_media_sharing.h<br />-rw-r--r--  1 root root   9951 Nov 15  2011 cl_ext.h<br />-rw-r--r--  1 root root   2630 Nov 17  2011 cl_gl_ext.h<br />-rw-r--r--  1 root root   7429 Nov 15  2011 cl_gl.h<br />-rw-r--r--  1 root root  62888 Nov 17  2011 cl.h<br />-rw-r--r--  1 root root 915453 Feb  4  2012 cl.hpp<br />-rw-r--r--  1 root root  38164 Nov 17  2011 cl_platform.h<br />-rw-r--r--  1 root root   1754 Nov 15  2011 opencl.h<br /></pre><br />Secondly, we need to make a choice in what library we'll use:<br /><br />The <b>amd-opencl-dev </b>package will install AMD's implementation, which you can read up on <a href="http://developer.amd.com/resources/heterogeneous-computing/opencl-zone/">here</a>. NVIDIA's package is installable through the <b>nvidia-opencl-dev</b>&nbsp;package which you can read up on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/opencl">here</a>. Finally, Intel's implementation is available through the <b>beignet-dev</b>&nbsp;package and you can read up on their implementation <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/opencl">here</a>.<br /><br />I went with AMD's.<br /><br /><pre class="brush: shell">$ sudo apt-get install amd-opencl-dev</pre><br />From here, it's time to write some code. I'll have some more blog posts on the way which will be walk-throughs for your first applications.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>

    <h1>Gouraud Shaing with Scan Line Polygons</h1>
<div class='post'>
<h3>Introduction</h3>In my <a href="http://cogsandlevers.blogspot.com.au/2013/11/scanline-based-filled-polygons.html">previous post</a>, we went through the basics of rasterising polygons on screen by use of horizontal lines. To sum up, we interpolated values along each edge of the polygon, collecting minimum and maximums for each y-axis instance.<br /><br />Today, we're going to define a colour value for each point on the polygon and interpolate the colours along each edge. This is the technique employed to draw polygons that are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouraud_shading">Gouraud shaded</a>.<br /><br /><h3>The Code</h3>The structure of this is very similar to drawing a single colour block polygon. For a solid colour polygon, we interpolated the x values over the length of the y values. We'll now employ this same interpolation technique over the red, green, blue and alpha channels of each colour defined for each polygon point.<br /><br />Here's the scanline function.<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7561758.js"></script> <br />An immediate code restructure difference here from the first tutorial, is I'm now passing an actual point object through as opposed to each component of each point being a function parameter. This is just to clean up the interface of these functions.<br /><br />We're creating differentials not only for x now but also the r, g, b and a components. These will form the start and ending colours for each horizontal line that we'll draw. We still have extra interpolation to do once we're in the horizontal line draw function as well. Here it is.<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7561819.js"></script> <br />Again, more interpolation of colour components. This is what will give us a smooth shading effect over the polygon.<br /><br />Finally, the actual polygon function is a piece of cake. It just gets a little more complex as we have to send in colours for each point defined.<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/tuttlem/7561874.js"></script> <br />Aside from the interface changing (just to clean it up a bit) and managing r, g, b and a components - this hasn't really changed from the block colour version. If you setup this polygon draw in a render loop, you should end up with something like this:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CiuOyHrMVSo/UoyhbG4z5OI/AAAAAAAAAw4/AcYzDBUEhmA/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-11-20+at+9.47.20+pm.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="156" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CiuOyHrMVSo/UoyhbG4z5OI/AAAAAAAAAw4/AcYzDBUEhmA/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-11-20+at+9.47.20+pm.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Smooth. <br /><br /><br /></div>
