A small bookmark to myself, wikibooks has an import of Johnathan Tang's [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](http://jonathan.tang.name/files/scheme_in_48/tutorial/overview.html) that I've come across.

Looks quite good if you've already gone through the language cruft that all of the other tutorials put you through first.
